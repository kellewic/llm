A\nnotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became\naffiliated with Cargill, Inc.\n    Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional\ncooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,\nof Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries\nin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and\nHarvest States in Minneapolis.\n    Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative\nFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.\n    Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives\nare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one\ncash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm\ncooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few\nmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.\n    Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the\nNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives\nexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.\n    \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has\nbeen quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of\nconsolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"\n    One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the\nmajor commercials for export, rather than exporting it\nthemselves, losing potential profits.\n    But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the\nmulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers\nExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make\nfolks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.\n    Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is\napproved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather\nthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics.\n    A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm\n\"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of\nmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of\ndoing business.\"\n    \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\n\"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.\nThere are plenty of capable firms.\"\n    Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing\nwith Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures\nthrough a Chicago-based cooperative.\n    \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to\nindividuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but\nadded, \"The times change and with changing times, come\ndifferent opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"\n    Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had\nnothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you\nthat this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy\norganization.\"\n    In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois\nCooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'\nequity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for\nthe most recent year has not been filed.\n    Under the cooperative system, income from operations is\nreturned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.\n    Income and refunds in the past five years have been\ndeclining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op\nreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0\nmln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,\n1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.\n    \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan\nsaid. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"\n    According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark\nowns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common\nshares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.\n    Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital\nGrowmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the\nfigure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.\nEquity is distributed according to each member's trading volume\nand, as a result, changes from year to year.\n    However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet\nminimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark\npulled out.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "NEW S.AFRICA ACCORD WITH BANKS BROUGHT COMPROMISE", "body": "A new agreement covering the repayment\nof part of South Africa's foreign debt represents a compromise\nbetween that country and its commercial bank creditors\nfollowing several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations,\nsenior banking sources said.\n    In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed\nthe agreement a \"good deal\" for both South Africa and the banks.\n    But as one senior banker noted, \"It is probably the best we\ncould hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the\nSouth Africans) didn't want to pay.\"\n    The new agreement will extend for three years the\nstandstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985\nand which was due to expire on June 30.\n    Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will\nreceive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the\narrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.\n    It also will require the repayment over the life of the\nstandstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over\nsix month invervals and depending on the maturity of the\nvarious debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion\ndlrs.\n    Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the\n14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers\nhad argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the\ncountry's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even\nlarger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had\nbeen speculation that the standstill would be extended for\nthree years, many did not believe that a long term pact would\nbe acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line\nin the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheid\npolicies.\n    The agreement reached today differs very little from the\none reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include\none moderation of an option contained in that pact which\nintroduces yet another \"catchphrase\" into the jargon for\nreschedulings.\n    The new agreement contains an \"exit vehicle\" under which\nbanks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the\nprevious agreement banks were only given options for three year\nloans.\n    While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it\ncould offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than\nhalf their investment over the next seven years.\n    To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower\nlooking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate\nindividually the interest rates to be charged.\n    The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan\nwould be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a\nrepayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of\nface value by year seven, one banker said.\n    Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and\neconomic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the\noption it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers.\nThey noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission is\nan active borrower in this area of the market.\n    Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chief\ndebt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill\nCoordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on\nthe commercial bank technical committee.\n    The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the\ncountry's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation\ncovering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.\n    Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa's\napartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with\nFritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank,\nacting as mediator.\n    Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not\ninvolved himself in the negotiations since last year, the\nbankers said.\n    Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal\nto Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time\nthe procedure will be less structured and will be up to the\nindividual banks as to how they wish to handle it.\n    Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the\nSouth Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement\non the repayments took many in the financial community by\nsurprise.\n    A review of South Africa's economy by the technical\ncommittee's economic sub-committee was to be held in February\nwhile the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some\ntime this month or next month.\n    However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity\nwhich surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings\nwere kept secret.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD", "body": "Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are\nreporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing\nprovisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-\nperforming loans.\n    Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build\nreserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a\nlittle this year.\n    But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems\nhampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will\nremain vulnerable.\n    One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely\ndone in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,\nbut banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\"\n    The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in\n1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has\ntaken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now\nappearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad\ndecline.\n    The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had\nsunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world\noil prices tumbled.\n    Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on\nthe Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and\nrevealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at\nthe expense of increased provisions.\n    The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United Saudi\nCommercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln\nriyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln.\n    Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part\nreflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly\ntrebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to\n60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.\n    Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank>\n(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7\nmln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi\nFrench, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.\n    Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N>\nCitibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,\nincreased provisions sharply.\n    <Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1\nmln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln\nriyals.\n    Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-\nperforming loans has stopped growing as the decline in the\nSaudi economy bottoms out.\n    Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic\nactivity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks\nare now at or close to international levels on provisions.\"\n    From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <National\nCommercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in\nprovisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the\nprivate sector, bankers calculated.\n    Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the\nsecond biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had\ncovered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate\non an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.\n    Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been\ntightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for\ndeclaring loans as non-performing.\n    Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures\ndifficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest\nas revenue while others follow more conservative practices in\nforce in major world financial centres.\n    Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the\njoint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank\nas the strongest earners.\n    Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by\nthe <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a\nrelatively low deposit base.\n    Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln\nriyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another\nlow figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most\nconservative in making provisions.\n    Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a\nSaudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank>\nafter its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made\navailable cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.\n    The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but\ngenerally banks are awash with liquidity since they are\nunwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.\n    And while banks in more liberal financial markets can\nattempt to diversify away from traditional lending,\nconservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate\nfee income from new investment banking products.\n    One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not\ngood.\"\n    Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of\nadvances is showing a declining trend, while the days when\nbanks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to\ninvest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return\non their money.\n    In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current\naccounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer\nfunds are held on current account.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The surplus\nwidened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion\ndlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.\n    Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative\nmoney flowed into Taiwan in 1986.\n    This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more\nthan 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last\nyear and provided further upward pressure on the currency.\n    The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against\nthe U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging\nspeculators.\n    Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week\nWashington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves\nmeant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.\n    Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the\ncurrency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow\nthe local dollar to find its own level.\n    \"Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the\ncentral bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want\nto take the risk,\" said one local banker.\n    He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary\nmeasure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with\nthe exchange rate problem.\n    The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt\naround the real issue, he said.\n    Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign\nexchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.\n    \"The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank\ncharges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,\" said the\nmanager of a European bank.\n    Economists criticised the controls, saying they could\nantagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic\nliberalisation in Taiwan.\n    \"Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has\nrestricted inflows,\" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers\nda Costa.\n    A local banker, who declined to be named, said, \"It's\nbasically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against\nthe government's liberalisation programme.\"\n    Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to\nenable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,\ntreasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow\nindividuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country\neach year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The numbers shipped to the United Arab\nEmirates and Bahrain fell, however.\n    Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been\noffset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean.\n    Other than livestock, Australia's overall meat sales to the\nMiddle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes\nthe previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of\nmutton and lamb to Iran.\n    Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being\nvirtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several\nyears.

A World Bank mission was due here\nsoon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.\n    Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40\nforeign governments.\n    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987\nbudget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.\n    In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was\nabout 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.\n    The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending\ncrude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil\naccounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60\npct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended\ninterest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.\n    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a\ncash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,\nwhich cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.\n    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact\nevery day this week with some of the banks who sit on its\n14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance\nofficial said.

{"title": "JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY", "body": "The worst may be just about over for\nJapan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect\na vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists\npolled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is\nlikely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising\nexports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The\neconomy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said\nSumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.\n    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu\nTaketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said.\n    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the\nfiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,\nfrom two pct in the current year, he said.\n    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst\nare increasing.\n    The volume of exports in the first two months of the year\nrose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward\nthe end of last year.\n    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a\nsharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,\nseveral economists said it could mark the beginning of a\nrecovery.\n    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller\nthan expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3\npct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey\nreleased last week showed that the decline in Japanese\ncorporate earnings may be nearing its end.\n    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes\nthe rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.\n    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And\nWest Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise\ncurrencies around current levels.\n    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two\nyears has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its\ncompanies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.\n    \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said.\n    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise\ninvestment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs\nof that yet, economists said.\n    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their\ncompetitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to\nrecover, economists said.\n    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some\nloosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo\nMuto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.\n    The next reading of the economy's health should come early\nnext week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,\n1986.\n    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from\nthe previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.\n    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter\nfigures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point\nquarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical\naberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.\n    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the\neconomy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth\nquarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.\n     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a\nstatistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of\n1986, the official said.\n    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also\ndistorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second\nhalf of 1986.\n    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their\npurchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer\nexpenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December\nbecause of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year\nbonuses, they said.\n    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from\nretailers because they were unsold, the government's\ncontribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been\nboosted, economists said.\n    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from\ngovernment buying of farm products as the domestic crop last\nyear was good.\n    The senior government official said the fourth quarter\nperformance of the domestic sector was probably worse than\ngenerally expected, while that of the external sector was\nbetter.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

World prices have been\nrecovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO\ntalks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos\nfor export in the first four months of this year.\n    The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening\nof May and June export registrations will be the amount at\nwhich the contribution quota is set.\n    With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms\nsuch as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being\nintroduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in\ndetermining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world\nmarkets, they said.\n    They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned\nincrease in the quota, April registrations were opened and\nclosed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record\namount for a single day.\n    If May/June registrations are opened under similar\nconditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in\nselling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.\n    \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said.\n    Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean\nthere are pressures from the government to boost exports to\nmaximise foreign exchange earnings.\n    However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a\nmarketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant\nposition as an exporter, but without causing a price war.\n    General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan\nto export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between\n1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.\n    The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around\nthe figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were\nreintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with\nthe breakdown of talks.\n    With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this\nyear, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after\nmeeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.\n    However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to\nconsider exporting such quantities, as this would almost\ninevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to\nencroach on other producers' markets.\n    Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly\nmarketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's\nmarket share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln\nbags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial\nrelations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance\nat the ICO talks, they added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS", "body": "U.S. retail sales rose sharply in\nFebruary but many economists said the underlying consumer\nspending trend remains weak.\n    February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0\npct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's\nsales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously\nreported 5.8 pct decline.\n    \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a\nmuch more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu\nCapital Markets Inc.\n    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data\nover past four months to show that the pace of consumer\nspending is slowing.\n    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November\nand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain\nover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4\npct rise for year-over-year sales through February.\n    \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't\nbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales\nprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in\nFebruary.\"\n    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were\nimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding\nautos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline\nin January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.\n    \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains\nin durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy\nof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy\nreport.\"\n    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February\nafter falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store\nsales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.\n    \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said.\n\"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report\ninto the future.\" \n    A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January\nwhich may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost\nspending in February, he said.\n    \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding\ntaxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this\ncountry get an increase in disposable income, the inclination\nis to go out and spend it,\" he said.\n    Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for\nthe first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of\nhow much this sector will add to first quarter spending.\n     Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total\nFebruary sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop\nin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely\nto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws\nJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.\n    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total\nsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the\nstrength in the February report is less than impressive.\n    \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because\nthey were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said\nBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a\nprecursor of continued strength.\"\n    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling\n17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained\n1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.\n    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,\nfollowing a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher\noil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales\nprobably accounted for these gains.\n    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending\nis weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion\ndlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they\nfell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in\nFebruary rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.\n    \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln\ndlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this\nas indication that the economy is barrelling along.\"\n    \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us\nwho are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt\nof Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.\n    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary\npolicy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.\n    \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so\nconfusing,\" he said.\n    \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll\nemployment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in\nMarch,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for\nthe first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in\nApril to sort things out.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP", "body": "Pessimism over the effects of a\nprolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is\nrising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln\nbag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.\n    Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of\nSalvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which\nbroke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as\nhoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the\nfirst three months of the May/September crop.\n    The sources said arrivals from May through July might only\nreach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of\n1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.\n    Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods\nfrom current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted\na late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which\nflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more\nlikely from late July on.\n    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices\nmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and\ninsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.\n    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over\n500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.\n    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,\nestimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely\nvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0\nmln bag mark if the disease hits.\n    Although flowering was good following the start of the\nrains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because\nthe drought had caused a drop in the insect population which\npollinates flowers, the sources said.\n    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are\nnow generally back to near normal levels and that current\nflowering and pod setting is good, which should result in\nmature fruit from August through September.\n    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of\nbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the\nmain crop, which officially starts on October 1.\n    \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go\nwell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break\nfrom August through November or even December,\" one said.\n    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove\naccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the\npast 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when\nprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln\nbags, the lowest since 1974.\n    Good growing conditions the following year produced a\ntemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag\nrecord, while last year's output, which also suffered some\ndrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.\n    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards\nby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.\n    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to\nhave been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and\nthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the\nend of the official crop year on April 30.\n    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the\ninclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port\nwarehouses but not declared.\n    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,\nsignificant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored\ntoo long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected\nto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.\n    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and\nmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks\nstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be\nat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,\nthe sources said.\n    This would compare with the previous record set last year\nof 6.03 mln.\n    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop\nbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao\nand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be\nofficially registered.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP <PCC>", "body": "Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on\nspecualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would\nfind a new suitor for the company, traders said.\n    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265\nmln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of\nits Purolator courier division's management.\n    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.\n    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned\nfrom its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.\n    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because\nthe merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from\nsoliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a\nbetter deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be\nfound if the company would agree to be sold to some other\nentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier\ndivision.\n    \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has\n450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's\nbeing sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,\" said Gardner in a telephone\ninterview with Reuters.\n    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm\nassociated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity\ncompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he\npersonally owns 20,000 shares.\n    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the\nletter from Gardner.\n    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service\nmay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the\ntransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also\nspeculated another courier company would be the most likely\nsuitor.\n    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no\nnew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed\nthe stock into play again.\n    \"There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question\nof management's willingness to let the process continue,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they\nbelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.\nHutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs\ncash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought\nfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.\ncourier operations.\n    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that\nHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and\nwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in\nPurolator.\n    \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from the\ndeal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.\nOne always likes a situation like that. You always like to\nthink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be\nsomeone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said one\narbitrager.\n    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and\nsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the\nfirm will not end up paying for its equity position.\n    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document\ndid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to\nkeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some\nrisk to the firm.\n    \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,\nand all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" said\none of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to\nemployees.\n    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs\nin so-called \"bridge\" financing for the transaction. The bridge\nfinancing is a temporary loan from Hutton.\n    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,\nexpected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to\nreplace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could\nbe a substantial expense to the firm.\n    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln\ndlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction\nsaid fees are at the low end of the scale.\n    \"It's a very complex transaction, but basically what\nhappens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture\nany investment they might have once the merger takes place,\"\nGardner said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

It may be a shame,\nbut we are locked into this,\" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),\nchairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed\ngrains. \"We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the\nfarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.\"\n    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill\nfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman\nsaid that it will probably be introduced next week.\n    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to\nforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency\npayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --\nonly an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under\nthe current bill.\n    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,\nhe said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet\nbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than\nsharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.\n    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a\ndifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.\n    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government\npayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this\npoint, he said.\n    \"I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a\ndecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,\" Glickman said\nat the hearing.\n    Sen.

His\nplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to\nparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to\nconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra\nidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres\nin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.\n    \"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but\nwe can at least move in that direction,\" Boschwitz said.\n    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified\nin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias\nin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'\ndependency on the government, he said.\n    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson\nsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.\n    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and\nthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose\nany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the\nfarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.\n    But when asked if his association were forced to choose\nbetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry\nJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92\nrather than take sharp cuts in target levels.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Howard Macdonald said in a statement.\n    \"We believe the plan is a rational one, and will be valid\nunder a range of circumstances,\" chairman Macdonald said.\n    The lenders previously agreed to an interim debt\nrescheduling until June 30 to allow Dome time to negotiate a\nlong-term recapitalization.\n    The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existence\nof the company, which would see lenders get maximum recovery of\ntheir loans, Dome said.\n    The plan would maintain debt levels within Dome's ability\nto pay, subject to minimum debt service levels for each lender.\n    Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equity\nconversion options and reclassification to lower interest\nbearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives.\n    Under certain circumstances, lenders will have the option\nto convert all or part of their debt to common shares at a\npre-determined conversion rate upon plan implementation.\n    The various conversion rates remain to be set through\nnegotiations, and the company said it is impossible to predict\nthe extent to which the conversion option will be exercised and\nthe amount of dilution that may result.\n    Converting debt to common shares after the plan is\nimplemented would be at a much higher conversion price, Dome\nsaid.\n    Common shareholders will be asked to approve the plan\nbefore it is put in place.\n    Debt that remains after share conversion will either\nreceive scheduled payments based on contract interest rates and\na 15 to 20 year pay-out, or interest rates indexed to oil\nprices. The company will use both an annual security-to-debt\nratio test and a monthly cash flow test to classify which\ninterest payments are paid on the different portions of debt.\n    To achieve a stable operating base for the company, the\nplan provides for deducting operating costs, capital\nexpenditures and general and administrative expenses before the\nremaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders, Dome\nsaid.\n    The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operate\nthe business as efficiently as possible, it said.\n    As the company previously said, debt payments from cash\nflow be divided into two broad categories, secured and\nunsecured creditors.\n    Terms of the debt plan include paying institutional\nunsecured creditors, comprising mostly banks who hold private\ndebt, from cash flow generated by unpledged assets. This\nportion will get a fixed low interest rate under a 15-year\nrepayment schedule.\n    Remaining institutional unsecured debt will get paid\nthrough convertible, oil indexed unsecured debt that matures in\n20 years, or any available excess cash flow, or conversion to\nequity. Any institutional lender also has the option of taking\nall or part of its debt in common shares.\n    To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity, Dome said\nthey can also convert all or part of their debt to common\nshares when the plan is implemented. Any debt leftover would be\nexchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest rate\nlinked to oil prices.\n    Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated by\nthe assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula,\nthe company said.\n    Any shortfalls under the formula could also be converted to\noil-linked debentures.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Interest\nrates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris\nClub rules, he added.\n     He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard\npenalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with\nArgentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.\n    He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from\ninternational agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400\nmln dlrs in disbursements this year.\n    The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed\nfrom a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow\nof 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.\n    Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now\nstood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in\ndisposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro\ntook office in August, 1985.\n    Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a\nyear in the government's first month in office, was now down to\n10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the\nplan was that it should continue at this level.\n    He said the government was also expecting at least three\npct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative\nrates.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The annual growth target for both is\n5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.\n    \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the\nFed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money\ngrowth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government\nSecurities Inc.\n    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary\ngrowth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,\nthey stress that money growth will not be strong enough to\nprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the\neconomy shows evidence of weakness.\n    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,\nSlifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money\nmarket deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four\nbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's\nweakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2\nand M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.\n    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return\nto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so\ncontinue to present no problem for the Fed.\n    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with\nits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps\nseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether or\nnot to ease its grip on reserves.\n    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts\nagreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose\nto raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next\nchanges policy.\n    \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as\nlow as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six\npct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct\nin the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.\n    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of\ncustomer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on\nMonday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added\nreserves directly through two-day System repurchases.\n    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate\nbe largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a\nborrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Ours is beginning to\nemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the\nimmediate future,\" he told journalists.\n    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export\npolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.\n    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when\nproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks\nhave been resolved.\n    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying\nIndonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to\nsuggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the\nBrazilian stand was quite clear.\n    He said Brazil's current quota \"reflects the reality of the\nmarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but\nadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that\ndetermined it.\n    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure\nof the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among\ndealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers\nwould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,\nwhich did not happen.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Caution was also evident in the\nPhilippine camp. \"We feel the ball's in the banks' court,\" one\nsource said. The two sides will meet again on Friday.\n    The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking to\nreschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominated\nby a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance\nminister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest\nbill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash.\n    Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in\ncash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR.\n    The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday,\nbut Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought\nto satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the notes\nwould yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash.    \n    The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the\nnew proposal.\n    Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm\nsupport for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hope\nthat the banks would embrace the idea.\n    But the banks are still being circumspect, weighing\npossible accounting consequences as well as considering the\nprecedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS.\n    One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S.\nlawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing to\nworry about.\n    \"To the extent that it's a precedent, it's a precedent to\nbe encouraged,\" Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb,\nSteen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conference\nsponsored by Euromoney magazine.\n    Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominated\nPINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert\nthem into pesos at face value to fund government-approved\nequity investments in the Philippines.\n    In effect, international firms would be paying part of\nManila's interest bill, allowing the government to conserve\nmuch-needed hard currency.\n    One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit,\nis that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations,\nwhich have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past\n4-1/2 years.\n    \"There's another pool of cash at the table now,\" he said.\n    David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,\ntold the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be\npart of a \"menu\" of options available to banks instead of pure\nnew-money packages.\n    He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion\ndlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.\n    \"We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising\nnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank\nsyndications,\" Mulford said.\n    In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, he\nsaid that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program and\ncriticism of communication and coordination within the bank\nsyndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to\nparticipate in the loan.\n    This refusal \"for a time appeared to jeopardize the\nprospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,\"\nMulford said.\n    The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20,\nbut bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new\nlife into the financing process, especially with crucial\nnegotiations with Brazil, about to start.\n    The banks for their part insist that they are more than\nwilling to discuss Mulford's \"menu\", and say it is the debtors\nthat need to be more flexible. For example, they say financing\ntalks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires\ndislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions that\nthe banks are promoting.

{"title": "U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT", "body": "Senior U.S. Economic officials\ndisagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget\ndeficit reduction targets.\n    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic\nAdvisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to\na tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting\nspending and fostering economic growth.\n    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional\nBudget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the\ndeficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.\n    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University\nthat spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the\ndesire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility\nfor local projects to state governments.\n    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the\nPresident to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to\nlimit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should\nbe linked more closely.\n    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct\ngrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and\n3.5 pct in 1988.\n    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of\neconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty\ngood to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\"\n    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,\n\"It looks like they're on track.\"\n    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,\nSprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.\n    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax\nreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will\ngreatly increase private production incentives, he said.\n    \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest\nnational net output of goods and services will permanently\nincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-run\nconsequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would\nhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the\nincome of the average American family.\"\n    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible\nfor the large increase in the budget deficit.\n    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted\nto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of\nGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.\n    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986\nfederal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points\nhigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.\n    \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981\ntax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget\ndeficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said.\n    \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax\nincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added.\n    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner\nargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.\n    \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes\nenormously without any plan to decrease spending by the\nAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence\nspending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)\nare unpleasant,\" he said.\n    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological\nturmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation\nin our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread\ndistrust of government.\n    \"The American people turned on the government with tax\nrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government at\nthe national level,\" Penner said.\n    \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike\nof spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake\ndemands that the system change a lot.\"\n    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget\ndeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will\nremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.\n    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is\nnot likely to succeed.\n    \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to\ndictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply\nbecause there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.\n    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget\ndeficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated\nby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes\nrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.\n    \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative\ntiming changes, like moving the military payday from the last\nday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988.

Lawson as recently\nas December 17 said that \"I very much doubt whether there will\nbe much scope for reductions in taxation in next year's budget.\"\n    The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate\nof tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, since every pound\noff the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party's\nspending plans look more painful to the electorate, analysts\nsay.\n    The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the\nbasic rate of income tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in\n1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, Treasury figures show.\n    Lawson's budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at\n1530 GMT, and is sure to echo the government's distinct tone of\noptimism, analysts say.\n     The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will\nbe based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic\nachievements and confidence for the future, they add.\n    But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987/88 by\nbetween one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economists predict,\nLawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR\nthan the outturn for this financial year.^M\n    That could leave him with a presentation problem,\neconomists say.\n    A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring\nmarkets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government\nwould stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget's\narithmetic seem over-optimistic, economists say\n    Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government's goals, as set\nout in its Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), of reducing\ninflation and raising economic growth.\n    Regarding monetary targets, some analysts expect him to\ndrop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterling M-3, while\nretaining the tamer M0 narrow measure. Few foresee any other\nmonetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting.\n    Analysts were surprised this week when the government\nsanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates, in an\nattempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market. Analysts\nhad expected the authorities to wait until after the budget.\n    Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated\nafter the budget. Many analysts foresee them falling by as much\nas a full percentage point from the current 10.5 pct level.\n    The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is\nto cut mortgage borrowing costs, and thus reduce inflation,\nanalysts say. Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage\nrate reduces retail prices by 0.4 pct, government figures show.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Discussions\nwith up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted in\npublic commitments.\n    Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing an\nuphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the\n2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 but\nits sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied medium\nrange jet with many identical components.\n    The British government remains unconvinced that there will\nbe sufficient room in the world long range jet market.\n    The West German government is also uncommitted, and is\ncurrently pressing for a restructuring of the consortium's West\nGerman company, <Deutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the French\ngovernment appears to be fully behind the program.\n    Another major factor delaying a final decision on the plane\nhas been the engine which will power it. Airbus agreed last\nOctober with <CFM International> that its CFM-56 engine with\n28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane. But in December,\nAirbus announced an agreement with CFM rival <International\nAero Engine> (IAE) to power a slightly larger version of the\nA340 with a 30,000 lb thrust high-technology superfan engine.\n   Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAE\nengine is now the principle engine for the project.  The\nincorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on paper\nmore attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to be\ndeveloped and CFM International had openly expressed scepticism\nthat the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service.\n    The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the right\ndecision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for it\ncould find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either by\nstaying absent from the long range jet market or by committing\nitself to a commercially unviable project.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Spending and taxing decisions should\nbe linked more closely.\n    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct\ngrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and\n3.5 pct in 1988.\n    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of\neconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty\ngood to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\"\n    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,\n\"It looks like they're on track.\"\n    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,\nSprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.\n    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax\nreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will\ngreatly increase private production incentives, he said.\n    \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest\nnational net output of goods and services will permanently\nincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-run\nconsequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would\nhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the\nincome of the average American family.\"\n    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible\nfor the large increase in the budget deficit.\n    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted\nto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of\nGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.\n    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986\nfederal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points\nhigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.\n    \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981\ntax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget\ndeficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said.\n    \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax\nincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added.\n    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner\nargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.\n    \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes\nenormously without any plan to decrease spending by the\nAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence\nspending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)\nare unpleasant,\" he said.\n    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological\nturmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation\nin our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread\ndistrust of government.\n    \"The American people turned on the government with tax\nrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government at\nthe national level,\" Penner said.\n    \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike\nof spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake\ndemands that the system change a lot.\"\n    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget\ndeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will\nremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.\n    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is\nnot likely to succeed.\n    \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to\ndictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply\nbecause there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.\n    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget\ndeficit was cut.

What it really is a narrowing\nof the spread that could be charged on new money,\" the official\nsaid.\n    This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backing\nfor a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial\npayment of interest in tradeable investment notes.\n    On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker\ntold Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative\none and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister\nJamie Ongpin later that day.

And they've gone all over the world, and\nat every stop they've been told the same thing.\"\n    The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible\neconomic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or\nthe International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy\nbefore commercial banks would begin negotiations.\n    As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and\nmajor debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach\nagreements stretching out debt repayments.\n    For its part, the administration has signaled its strong\nsupport for new techniques that in some cases effectively\namount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.\n    It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead\nof bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord.\n    Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have\nalso debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in\nbuilding up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.\n    The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under which\nbanks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate\nloans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it\nis believed payments will resume.\n    More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and\nenergy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,\nhas suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.\n    Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that\nprovisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade\nlegislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.\n    But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY", "body": "The European Monetary System marks its\neighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money\nmarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stability\nin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,\nwhich holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\nfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\n    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\nbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\nseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\n    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\nEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\nwhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.\n    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\nblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's\nfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\nformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.\n    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\nafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\ntransferred from national governments and central banks to an\nautonomous European Monetary Fund.\n   But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\neconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\nthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\nsituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\neconomist who has closely watched the system's development.\n    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\nthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\nsystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\n    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\ninvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\nrise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE\n    As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against\nEMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as\nWest Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several\nEC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow\nthe mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease\nfinancial and trade strains within the community.\n    Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued\nby three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct\nagainst other currencies in the system -- the French franc,\nItalian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.\n   Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the\nEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\ncurrency, outside the system.\n    No change in the British government's attitude is expected\nbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.\n    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it\nwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's\nhighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\nBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\n    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\nhold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\n    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\nmore than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\nabout the chances for any fundamental change.\n    \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS\nagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\nmust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\nde Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.\n    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend\nlargely on the success of an agreement last month among major\nindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar\nresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they\npredict.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very\nfibre of the market,\" said a senior official at a U.S. Bank.\n    As prices have fallen, he explained, the underwriters who\noriginally brought the issues have retreated. They have\ndivested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible,\nunwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic\ntrading.\n    In the virtual effective closure of the market for\nperpetual floaters last month, bankers witnessed the\nconsequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and\ninvestor confidence.\n    Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis\ninfecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues, which is\nalmost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals, with an\nestimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.\n    \"The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory\nthat they will sell at any price,\" said an official at a leading\nU.S. Bank, explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices\ndown sharply over the last two days.\n    Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today's trading was\nunique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and\nthat there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities\nthey sold.\n    In highlighting this point, dealers noted that the\nbenchmark issues in the FRN market -- the two FRN's for the\nU.K., Launched in 1985 and 1986 -- fell an unprecedented 50 and\n40 basis points, respectively, at the opening this morning.\n    Certainly, dealers said, Britain is no less credit-worthy\ntoday than it was yesterday and the country's economic health\ncurrently appears better than it has for some time.\n    Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra-national\ndebt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness, one senior FRN\nsource said: \"The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the\nfact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated\nloan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay.\"\n    Dealers agreed that banking sector paper, which constitutes\na significant part of the market, was currently under pressure.\n    Floating rate debt of major U.S. And Canadian banks eased\nmarkedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor\nfears about the banks' exposure to Latin American debt.\n    The U.S. And Canadian money centre bank FRNs, along with\nRepublic of Ireland paper, were hard hit again this week with\ndealers citing one heavily-traded Citicorp note falling to\nlevels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points\nover Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate).\n    By comparison, the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998\nyielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid (the London\nInterbank Bid Rate) when it was issued in January last year.\n    Price declines of this size can really only be explained by\nan understanding of the operating practices of leading players\nin the market, dealers and banking analysts said.\n    \"This has to be understood as a matter between banks who\nhave a brief to buy low and sell high,\" one U.S. Bank source\nnoted.\n    Another senior source at a U.K. Bank drew attention to the\nenormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the\nlast few years in the FRN market, which have to be justified.\n    But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk,\ndealers said, is the way the securities are bought and sold.\n    Although sophisticated on-screen dealing exists in most\nmarkets, in the euro-markets trading is conducted by telephone.\n    \"If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price\nin any issue, and you do, he can say \"Right. You own five mln',\"\na trader said, explaining market practice.\n    The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the\nsecurities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even\nlower price, the trader explained.\n    It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid\ndownward price spiral earlier today, traders said, adding that\nit is likely to continue until the markets either regain their\nconfidence or market practices change.\n    One possible solution, dealers said, would be to initiate\ntrading exclusively through brokers' screens, so that only\nthose who wanted to buy bonds would have to \"lift a bid\" or buy\nat that price.\n    Meanwhile, bank regulators are apparently concerned about\nthe implications of the collapse in FRN prices.\n    Traders in London said that the Bank of England has called\naround to market makers asking whether they intended to\ncontinue trading and what they calculated the losses to be.\n    The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market, but\ndealers said the latest enquiries were more specific.\n    A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to comment\nimmediately on the Bank's action.\n    One trader at a major U.S. Bank here said that in addition,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York's international capital\nmarkets unit has phoned banks in London today seeking\ninformation about trading in FRN's.

Young at a press\nconference, patients with life threatening diseases who are not\nenrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to an\nexperimental therapy. The policy also allows drug companies to\nsell the promising drugs to patients.\n    Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider use\nfree-of-charge if the agent was shown to be effective. Under\nthe new policy, the FDA could only refuse to permit a physician\nto administer an experimental drug if it was shown to be\nunsafe.\n    Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefit\nbiotechnology companies with few or no products approved for\nmarketing in the U.S., but would have little economic impact on\nlarge drug companies with many other sources of revenue.\n    \"Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could help\nbiotech companies' near-term financial situation and help make\nthem less dependent on outside sources,\" said Teena Lerner, a\nbiotech analyst at L.F. Rothchild.\n    Other observers were concerned that drug companies would be\nput into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to have\ndevastating side effects.\n    \"Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs they\nare going to have to think long and hard about liability--the\nproduct liability problems are enormous,\" said a\nWashington-based lawyer who specializes in the drug field.\n    Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informed\nconsent papers before taking an investigational drug. The\nlawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suits\nagainst a drug company's investigational drug.\n    \"The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish,\" said\nthe lawyer. \"Drug companies are right now probably meeting with\ntheir insurance companies.\"\n    Burroughs-Wellcome Co, the U.S. arm of the British firm\nWellcome PLC that makes AZT, Merck and Co Inc <MRK>,\nHoffman-LaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp <SKB> said it\nwas too soon to comment on the policy.\n    \"I'm very uncomforable with this,\" said Wellcome\nspokeswoman Kathy Bartlett. \"We haven't had a chance to\nformulate a response yet.

On the inflation\nfront, all is well,\" he said. \"Money supply is well under\ncontrol. It's an absolutely ideal situation.\"\n    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly\nless than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.\nThis compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production\nnumber, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.\n    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,\nless than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct\nrise in the PPI in January.\n    \"The Fed is going to look at this positively,\" said Allan\nLeslie of Discount Corporation. \"Certainly inflation is not as\nbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial\nproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.\"\n    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in\nFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.\n    \"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation\nis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per\nbarrel,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The\ntrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.\"\n    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct\ndecline in the PPI.\n    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,\nbut a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices\nfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.\n    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that\na possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both\nthe financial markets and the Federal Reserve.\n    \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations\ntoday,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.\n    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier\nmonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this\ncould necessitate a weaker dollar.\n    \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" he\nsaid. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with\nforeign producers.\"\n    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct\nin February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced\noverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising\nprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.\n    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish\noverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might\nnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.\n    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8\npct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to\na large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value\nof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.\n    Slifer said import prices may rise further as\nmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped\nto current levels expire, and new contracts are made that\nreflect a weaker dollar.\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported\nmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the\nsecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.\nindustrial output.\n    \"It's the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said.\n\"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive\nand they are increasing output.\"\n    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average\nindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.\n\"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is\nbeginning to revive.\"\n    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not \nconvinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He\nsaid much of the strength came from factors that do not point\nto a sustained rise in industrial output.\n    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm\nequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in\nFebruary business equipment production.\n    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2\npct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy\nwas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.\n    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for\nhalf of the industrial production gain as production of auto\nassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5\nmillion units.\n    \"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are\nproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at\nroughly a seven mln unit rate,\" Roach said. \"The disparity\nbetween output and sales is showing up in inventories.\"\n    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business\ninventories as a sign that production may be outstripping\ndemand in the first quarter of 1987.\n    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain\nsince July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce\nDepartment said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the\nlargest monthly sales drop on record.\n    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to\nmonth-to-month changes. \"The Fed has been standing pat for the\nlast seven months,\" Ramirez said. \"They will continue to stand\npat for at least the next couple of months.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Furthermore,\nRepresentatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers\nand life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree\non a method of establishing the market.\n    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,\nFCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a\nfarm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture\n\"as long as the farm credit system is a key player.\"\n    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the\nsecondary market could be established either with Congressional\nlegislation or administratively.\n    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the\nsuccessful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government\nNational Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.\n    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main\nsupporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe\nit would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in\nrural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,\ntraditionally the largest lender to farmers.\n    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell\nhigh-quality loans on farmland to \"poolers,\" who in turn would\npackage the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for\nresale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents.\n    The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in\nthe past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any\nfarm secondary market established in the private sector which\nexcluded the farm credit system would put the system at a\ncompetitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to\nthe system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,\nNaylor and farm credit system officials have said.\n    However, the system and FCA have become more positive to\nthe idea recently because the system could benefit if it were\nappointed the agent for a secondary market.\n    \"If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools\nof farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged\nfor providing this service,\" the Life Insurers' study said.\n    Congressional sources believe a secondary market available\nto both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the\nsystem as agent, could be included in a major federal\ngovernment rescue package for the system to be drafted by\nCongress later this year.\n    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the\nsecondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,\nconcludes that the farm credit system's market share in rural\nlending would fall if a secondary market were established.\n    The study was released earlier today.\n    The study said a secondary market could be established with\nvirtually no federal money if the government provided a\nguarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private\nco-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.\n    It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the\neight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year\nwould qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,\nexpanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.\n    The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who\nmeet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would\nfall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.\n    The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why\nleading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm\nBureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.\n    Proponents say a secondary market also would increase\nliquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "TALKING POINT/BANK STOCKS", "body": "CitiCorp <CCI> appears to be digging\nin its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of\ndollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall\nStreet analysts said.\n    \"I view it as pre-negotiation posturing,\" said analyst\nCarole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both\nBrazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on\nits commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first\nquarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it\nlists the loans as non-performing status.\n    Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, indicating a material change in its financial\nsituation. \"Citicorp is saying  you can't scare us with\nthreats, we'll make your loans non-performing right now,\"\nBerger said.\n    The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90\ndays without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation\nwill be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.\n    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by\ntalking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between\nU.S. and European banks.\n    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is\nunlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half\nof this year.\n    \"Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on\nall the interest they owe,\" Cohn said. \"The real issue is the\nrescheduling of debt terms.\n    Another question is whether or not the International\nMonetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.\n    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in\nlate dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off\ntheir lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.\n    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on\nnon-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said\ninvestors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at\npresent levels for the \"tremendous fundamental values\" in the\ngroup.\n    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said\nManufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC) has the greatest exposure to\nBrazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of\nearnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among\nNew York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co <JPM> and Bankers Trust\nCo <BT> which happen to have the least exposure.\n    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers\nTrust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have\nlower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. \n    In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more\ninvolved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up\na brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed\ncountries.\n    \"I don't see any reason to change full year earnings\nestimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He\nthinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a\nsituation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.\n    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became\nnon-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks\ncame to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was\npaid. \"What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,\"\nhe said.\n    He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a\nworst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that\nBrazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through\nsome economic upheaval after the transition from a military to\na civilian government.\n    \"The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative\nto their ability to service it,\" said John Mason of\nInterstate Securities. \"We've been fiddling around with these\nproblems for five years and the hour is growing late.\"\n    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut\ninterest rates internally and extended maturities and none of\nthese measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of\nas much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees\npartial write downs of some loans.\n    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks \ncould be poised for a short term rally.\n    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp <FNB> said it is\npremature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. \"It is our\nexpectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet\nits debt,\" a spokesman said.\n    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to\nmake a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said\nmuch the same thing.\n    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3\nbillion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is\nsubject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment of\ninterest.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Some trade sources said\nrecent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop\nbe revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln\nannounced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.\n    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect\nSoviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.\n    Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the\nUSSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its\nArgentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln\ntonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also\ncut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.\n    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this\nyear's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln\ntonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.\n    \"Significant downside potential\" still exists for the\nArgentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the\namount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.\n    \"If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been\nthinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can\nprovide during the April to June period,\" he said.\n    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked\nSoviet buying.\n    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market\nearlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn\nfor 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet\nsources said.\n    \"This price difference makes American corn competitive,\"\nAlbert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,\ntold Reuters.\n    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause\nthose prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn\nfutures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have\nbottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.\n    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the\nminimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains\nagreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to\nconvince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.\n    In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary\nRichard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat\nsubsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Wednesday borrowings were\n1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\n    \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\nprobably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\n    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\nmodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\ntwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\naround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\n    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\ntwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\noften pushes up borrrowings.\n    \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\nlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\nlate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said\nWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\nthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\nmore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\n    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\nits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\nreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\n    The Fed took no market reserve management action last\nThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\ntemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\ncustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\ndirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\ntwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\nTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's\novernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\n    \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\nthis time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\n    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\nsaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\nrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\neconomies in the United States and abroad and add to the\nfinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\n    \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\nstatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\ntumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\n    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\nstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday's\nWashington meetings of international monetary officials failed\nto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\n    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\nWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\nthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\nimbalance between the United States and Japan.\n    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\nsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\nFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\nthe rate has been since early November.\n    \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\npolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of\nDean Witter.\n    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\nnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\nsix to 6.10 pct previously.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Interest rates fell\nsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\nmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\noften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n    \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\nfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\nDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\nfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\ncredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\nof further depreciation of the dollar.\n    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\nworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\naway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\ndlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\nin interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\nby 33 points to 2339.\n    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\nmarkets' instability frightening. He believes economic\nfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\nyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n    \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\ndestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\nand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\nin Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\ncontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n    \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\nthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\nyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\nwould take very little to touch off what he calls the second\nphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\ndollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\nMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\nhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\nnot affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\ndecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\nweakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\nsuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\nbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\npart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\nconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\nplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\nimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\nreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\naddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\nmassive budget deficit.\n    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\ncentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\nchoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n    \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\nsubstantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\ncut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\nrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\nAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\nCo, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\nReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\nagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\nweakness,\" he said.\n    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\nmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n    \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\nbudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\ncares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\nwill have been greater.\n    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\nthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\na further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\nyour helmets,\" Giordano said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "GERMAN CAPITAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION STALLS", "body": "West Germany's capital market\nliberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried it\nmay take years for further reforms to be completed.\n    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banks\nreceived Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.\n    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominated\ncertificates of deposit last year. But other changes, including\nrevisions in the domestic options market and introduction of\nfutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may\ntake years, bankers and dealers say.\n    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians called\nlast week for an enlargement of current capital market\ninstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.\n    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,\nciting declines in West German share prices in the first two\nmonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.\n    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack of\nviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading\nin domestic markets too risky.\n    \"We need a stock index futures contract, and a futures\ncontract for recent government bonds,\" one dealer said.\n    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct of\nshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about\n30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.\n    Options can only be written on the original 14 bonds\nselected when bond options were introduced last April. The most\nrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.\n    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. German\nbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branches\nabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent\nWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on a\none-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.\n    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing\nmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.\n    Private individuals and corporations do not engage in\noptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchange\nlaws, which define losses made in futures and options business\nas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.\n    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from\npension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these\ninstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the business\nsoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rules\ngoverning funds.\n    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutual\nfunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be\nadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.\n    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the\npast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which\ngives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for their\nintroduction here is growing.\n    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankers\nconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in West\nGermany. They say that without innovations, some business could\ndrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.\n    An official at the London International Financial Futures\nExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans to\nintroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing\nmark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying the\nfeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month\nmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.\n    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank has\nno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization\nin that sector is still in the early planning stages after\nearlier talks ended two years ago.\n    Considerations about the futures business have been drawn\nout because of the large number of participants involved in\ntalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the Federal\nBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchanges\nand their governing states, and the four West German banking\nassociations.\n    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested\ninclude replacing the federal government's current bond\nconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one being\nconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.\n    This would upset the existing market order providing German\nand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it\nwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently\narise within the fixed consortium quota system.\n    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bond\ntrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a system\nof continuous price-setting from the current system in which\nevery bond price is fixed once a day.\n    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced the\nproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct\nof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "EURO-MEDIUM TERM NOTES POISED FOR GROWTH", "body": "Euro-medium term notes, a recent\nphenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardly\nattracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doing\ntheir best to breath life into the market.\n    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering success\nin the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown to\naround 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as a\nnew financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercial\npaper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,\ninvestment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for the\neuromarket.\n    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan Stanley\nInternational, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference on\nMTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument for\nraising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. \"It (the MTN\nmarket) will even surpass the bond market,\" he said.\n    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNs\nwill grow. But they generally agreed that these instruments\nprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs\nthan a traditional bond.\n    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is worth\narranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude\nEuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.\nCounterparts -- to buy the securities.\n    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one is\nexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing\nthese issues.\n    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced but\nonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of\nPepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.\n    Several firms have devised different structures for\nEuro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.\n    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuously\noffered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes with\nsimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.\n    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised\nby Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of a\nminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.\nThe borrower then issues additional notes in this category up\nto a pre-determined maximum.\n    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such as\nWendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point to\nthe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.\n    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers the\nEuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a\nmajor concern for these buyers.\n    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends the\nmedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable\nliquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be the\nright option for all borrowers.\n    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,\nHadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could well\ndetermine which structure is chosen.\n    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined\n\"lock-up\" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In the\ncase of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the \"lock-up\" period is\nthe 90 days after the completion of a series during which time\na security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.\nInvestors.\n    However, he said that the Securities and Exchange\nCommission is reviewing its current regulations on the\nownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that some\nsoftening in the rules could come in the not too distant\nfuture.\n    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea\npigs.\n    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the Nordic\nInvestment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB would\nhave said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, but\nthat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.\n    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to\nestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.\nDomestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issue\nglobally. Under NIB's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has been\nsold in the U.S. And 25 mln in Europe.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The five institutes had jointly forecast\nthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\nand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n    The joint report said that the estimates of economic\ndevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\nfavourable\" than those of the other three.\n    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\nslow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\nhowever, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n    The two institutes said external economic factors which\nwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\ndominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\nexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\nmarked improvement in the course of the year.\n    The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\ndemand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\nindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\nuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\nBut they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\nbut only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n    They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\nof the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\ncombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\ndemand and production could be expected by the spring.\n    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\nfurther development of the mark against the dollar.\n    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\nwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of the\neconomy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\nwill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\nthe course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\nin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\nrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\nwhile DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\npredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\nunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\njobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\nmln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\nwork of about 200,000.\n    These three institutes said new jobs would be created\nmainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\nthe context of job creation measures. The construction industry\nwas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\nbut they predicted either no rise in employment in the\nmanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\nin the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\nmanufacturing industry will decline.\"\n    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\nbillion marks from 78 billion in 1986.

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\ntelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\nthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n    \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\nadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\ndrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\ndollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\nartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\nnot healthy.\"\n    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\nrecession, he said.\n    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\nlife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\nor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\nmight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\nunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n    \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\nare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\nagreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\nwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\ndecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\nstabilizing currencies at current levels.\n    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\nto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\nprotectionism.\n    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\ndomestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\npromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\naction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\ncurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\nthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\n    The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\nbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\nthe policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\n    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\nagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\nwith the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\nview that around current levels their currencies are within\nranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's\nstatement read.\n    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\nfocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\nTrade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\nrather than prospective policy changes.

They have high hopes they will\nbe upheld if the case goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt.\"\n    Margoshes said he did not anticipate any significant\nchanges in Texaco's oil exploration and production business\nbecause the bankruptcy filing affects only about four pct of\nthe giant oil company's 32.6 billion dlrs in annual revenues.\n    Texaco executives said the bankruptcy filing would\neffectively halt payments of stock dividends and repayment of\nits 6.8 billion dlr debt, but added that the company's assets\nfar exceeded its liabilities.\n    \"Texaco's cash flow is at a very respectable rate of about\n15 dlrs per share annually,\" Margoshes said. \"Obviously, the\npoint of Chapter 11 was not so much seeking protection from\ncreditors as it was seeking protection from the predator\nPennzoil.\"\n    The two companies have been locked in an acrimonious\nstruggle since a Texas state court jury in November 1985\nordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil 10.53 billion dlrs for\nimproperly interfering with Pennzoil's planned acquisition of\nGetty Oil Co. In a major setback for Texaco last week, the U.S.\nSupreme Court said Texaco must abide by Texas state law that\nrequires posting a bond for the full amount of the judgment\nwhile the merits of the case were appealed.\n    Although a Texas appeals court hearing was scheduled Monday\n(April 13) on Texaco's motion to reduce the amount of the bond\nrequired under state law, Texaco elected not to risk losing the\nimportant court ruling that could have required it to post more\nthan 10 billion dlrs in collateral.\n    The bankruptcy filing, analysts said, effectively freezes\nall of Texaco's obligations while it continues to appeal the\nmerits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.\n    \"This is a drastic measure,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, an\nanalyst with L.F. Rothschild in New York. \"But it's also an\nindictment of the legal system in this country in that Texaco\nwas forced to seek bankruptcy when it couldn't get a fair\nhearing.\"\n    Ilacqua predicted that the Texas jury judgment would\nultimately be overturned or whittled down from its original\n10.53 billion dlrs, an amount that is increasing by about 2.5\nmln dlrs in interest accumulated daily. Texaco has contested\nthe ruling, insisting that Pennzoil did not have a valid\ncontract under New York state law to acquire Getty Oil.\n    Suggestions by some experts that the Texaco bankruptcy\nmight be an incentive for Pennzoil to lower its settlement\ndemands, which are widely believed to be between 3 billion and\n5 billion dlrs, were discounted by indignant Pennzoil\nexecutives.\n    \"I think it makes it much more difficult to settle,\" said\nBaine Kerr, Pennzoil's retired president who has acted as the\ncompany's chief negotiator in the Texaco litigation. \"I think\nthat's one of the main reasons they did it.\"\n    Joseph Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the\ncompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on\nSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for\nbankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal,\nciting a confidentiality agreement between the two companies.\n    \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they\nchose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said. \"This was an\nirresponsible and unneeded move.\"\n    Ilacqua also said the bankruptcy filing appeared to\neliminate any chance of settlement in the near-term.\n    \"There have been some crazy numbers floating around in\nsettlement discussions,\" Ilacqua said. \"I think 1 billion dlr\nsettlement would be more than adequate for Pennzoil. I don't\nknow if that Texas jury really understood what money is. They\ngave Pennzoil an astronomical judgment.\"\n    Analysts said they expected Texaco stock, which closed\nFriday at 31 and 7/8, to slip to about 25 when the New York\nStock Exchange opened Monday morning.\n    Lawyers for Pennzoil said they believed the company would\nprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were\nample enough to ultimately pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

But experience has\nshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price\nrise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.\n    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may\nseem exaggerated, they said.\n    \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price\nclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into\na restrictive policy,\" they said.\n    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are\nless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.\n    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary\nexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic\ninvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital market\ninvestments following lower interest rates.\n    \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of\ncentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a\nsmaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.\n    A return to growth and stability did not require\nspectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with\nopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid\nan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.\n    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be\nfocused simply on growth of production potential. Because of\nuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic\nweakness other factors should be taken into account.\n    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts\nand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation\nspeculation.

Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner\nthat is extraordinarily aggressive.\"\n    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gathering\npace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a\nfinancial system that restricted internationalisation of the\nriyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting\ndifficult.\n    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, have\ngenerally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth\nsuccessive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into\nalready dwindling earnings.\n    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy\nalthough it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.\n    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously\ndormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.\n    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,\ngiving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase\nagreements.\n    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolished\nwithholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.\n    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a new\ncommittee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank\ndisputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.\n    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to use\nmortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.\n    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock market\ntrading floor is expected to be opened.\n    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi\nIndustrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be used\nto trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11\ncommercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a\nnew computer network has been set up.\n    One banker said: \"The abolition of withholding tax will give\nbanks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as\ninterest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance\nMinistry are opening up markets for investment banking.\"\n    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked\ninto reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance\nto extend further loans to the private sector.\n    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that the\nreligious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with the\nKingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible\nfor them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.\n    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,\nbut found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a\nseries of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively\nexpensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.\n    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill\nin bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the\nmountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant\nfamilies also called for change, bankers said.\n    \"Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force\nchange -- they stopped lending,\" another banker said. \"That was\nstifling growth of the economy.\"\n    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be\nset up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more\nefficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, the\nCommittees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).\n    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,\nwill simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series\nof private deals with creditors.\n    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on\ninterest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.\n    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA\nand the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were\nnot the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.\n    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.\nFinance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a\nnew body would examine late government payments to contractors.\n    In addition, further moves are under way to align business\nlife to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urged\nto adopt it as their financial year.\n    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years ago\nby banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,\nbankers say.\n    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities\ntransactions with any party on the list.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Commission would have been passed along to customers\nwho did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less\nexpensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.\n    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with\nthe dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the\nallotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a\nconcurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of\nmarket conditions.\n    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be\ndisappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with\nthe plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any\nconditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned\nor modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient\nor unwieldy.\n    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first\nauction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional\nshort-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.\n    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial\nyear would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated\nstock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to\none billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in\nmaturity.\n    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be\nmet by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government\nbroker.\n    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the\nBank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a\n28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock\nof the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling\nthe stock once the fallow period expires.\n    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold\nare substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank\nwill agree to take the stock onto its own books.\n    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the\nfallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender\nprice.\n    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will\nbe alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders\nare allotted stock at the price which they bid.\n    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any\nmoney market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single\nauction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about\npreventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to\ndrive the price up.\n   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent\ndealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing\nadditional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.\n    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the\nauction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,\nwhich is widely expected to be on the same day.\n    Information to be released will include the amount of stock\nallotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,\nand the highest, lowest and average price of the successful\nbids.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking\nat it - that it's worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst Richard\nHenderson said.\n    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.\n    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill\nLynch officials did not return phone calls.\n    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman\nsought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics\nbusiness.

The\npartners in the space station are currently slated to be\nCanada, Japan, and the 13-nation European Space Agency, the\nlatter two of which also have or are developing their own\ncommercial space programs.\n     Until the Challenger explosion in January 1986, NASA had a\nvirtual lock on the world's commercial space cargo.\n    But after a re-evaluation of the shuttle program, President\nReagan declared last August that future U.S. shuttle flights\nwill no longer carry commercial payloads.\n    The administration's decision left Arianespace, a\nFrench-led European consortium, the only option available to\nsatellite owners and the concern quickly sold out all its\nplanned flights through 1989.\n    The company also raised its prices, from 30,000 dlrs a\nlaunch to 50,000 dlrs, but even the larger price tag did not\ndampen demand. Arianespace sighned 18 new contracts last year,\ncompared with 11 in 1985.\n    Those kind of tariffs have caused even non-capitalist\ncountries to try and get a piece of the action.\n    China, the Soviet Union and Japan have all announced\nsatellite launch programs and several U.S. firms, including\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp, General Dynamics Corp and Martin\nMarietta promised to spend mlns of dollars over the next three\nyears to develop their own satellite launch capabilities.\n    There will be some tremendous pent-up demand for satellite\nlaunches by then, analysts said. Without Challenger, there were\nonly three satellite launches last year, 15 fewer than in 1985\nand the lowest since 1980, when only two were sent up.\n    Ariane expects to launch from six to eight satellites a\nyear for the next three years, about 75 pct of the world's\nsatellite launches during that period.\n     McDonnell Douglas scored the biggest coup of the U.S.\nfirms in January when it won a 734 mln dlr U.S. Air Force pact\nfor up to 20 unmanned rockets to launch military satellites.\nThe contract is expected to underwrite the company's efforts to\nbuild rockets for private satellite launches.\n      Martin Marietta, however, was the first U.S. company to\nsign up a client, Federal Express Co. Marietta plans to launch\nan ExpressStar communications satellite in 1989.\n    Marietta said it will also build a version of its Titan\nrockets used by the Air Force to other private companies that\nwant to get into the satellite launch buisiness.\n    Arianespace director Charles Bigot said the U.S. companies\nwill probably become the European firm's biggest competitors\nfor satellite launching. He does not expect the national space\nprograms to become commercially viable until the late 1990s.\n    Japan has expanded its space program, launching 38\ngovernment-owned satellites in the last 16 years. But most of\nthem were small and it was only in February it launched its\nfirst satellite that circles the earth over the poles.\n    Japan also has yet to design and build its own rockets. The\nsatellite launched in February was placed in orbit by a\nMcDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled by the\nJapanese under license.\n    Tsugo Tadakawa, director of the Washington office of\nJapan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA), said Japan\nplans to launch seven of its H-1 rockets, an American Japanese\nhybrid that replaces the Delta, through 1991. Its much larger\nsucessor, the H-II, should be ready by 1992, he said.\n    NASDA's annual budget is only about 800 mln dlrs, Tadakawa\nsaid, about 10 pct the size of NASA's yearly spending.\n    Still, NASDA is free from private competition at home and\nhas the full support of the government, since aerospace was\nchosen by the Ministry of Trade and Information as one of the\ncountry's new industries for the next decade.\n     Surprisingly, the People's Republic of China, a relative\nnewcomer to aerospace, is so far the most successful competitor\nto Ariane.\n    The country's Great Wall Industry Corp is the only national\nprogram besides the European consortium to win a private\nsatellite contract.

Lanston and Co.\n    \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\nnear future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\ncosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\nsaid Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\n    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\nbecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\ndemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\nrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\n    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\nshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\nsaid \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\nstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\n    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\ndollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\nfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\nsaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\n    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\nstabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\ninterest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\n    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\non Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\nclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\nin the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\n    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\nrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\nthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\n    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\nmarket than most economists had expected.\n    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\namounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\nwith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\nhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\ntoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\nround of customer repurchase agreements.\n    \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\noffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\nsaid Jones of Lanston.\n    \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\nneed to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\nmerely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\nmajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\novertly at some point.\"\n    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\nbecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\nfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\n    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\nwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\nfurther aid the dollar.\n    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\n30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\nmay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\n    \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\npolicy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\nsaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\nLeslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\nabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.\nMorgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits\nto cover transactions, it said.\n    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose\nfrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over\nthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.\n    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's\nplea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.\n    \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they\ncould,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court\nruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting\nsupplies.\n    \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an\navalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we\ncould not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\"\n    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in\njeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages\nby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton\nsaid.\n    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,\ncanceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,\nOccidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and\nAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.\n    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last\nweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil.

Talks were also expected to take place with the\nAlgerians, he added.\n    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter\n11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines\nand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.\n    \"It will be business as usual for Texaco,\" said Martin\nKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer\nand Traub.\n    \"Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,\" he said. \"But\nwhen the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and\nwill likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.\"\n    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately\navailable to say whether discussions were being held with its\nbanks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

It rose as high\nas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome\nhas normally moved by only a few cents per day.\n    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr\nCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but\nDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still\ntalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.\n    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed\nto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday\nstressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial\ndifficulties of Dome Petroleum.\"\n    \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont\n<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian\ninterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert\nof Peters and Co Ltd.\n    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British\nPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite\nBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent\nof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.\n    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said\nin recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks\nwith Dome.\n    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,\nConoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.\n    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully\noptimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome\nshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10\ndlrs Canadian per common share.\n    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred\nshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which\nwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada\nwould own 80 pct.\n    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the\npotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The\nTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\"\nhe said.\n    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the\nupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\"\n    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87\nbillion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another\none billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to\nsecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a\ncertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.\n    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion\nCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on\nseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the company\nwanted to expand.\n    \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable\nof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that\nbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\"\nGobert said.\n    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it\nis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds\nreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion\ncubic feet of natural gas.\n    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres\nof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the\nheart of Canada's oil industry.\n   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of\nland across Canada.\n   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs\nCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.).

Jamail suggested that the refinery and chemical\nplant, valued at about 1.1 billion dlrs, were deliberately\nplaced out of reach of the Texas jury judgment.\n    But Richard Lieb, an attorney with Kronish, Lieb, Weiner\nand Hellman in New York, said Texaco could elect to place\nadditional subsidiaries into bankruptcy if necessary.\n    In the petition filed Sunday, only Texaco Inc, the\ncorporate parent, and two financial subsidiaries were included\nin the bankruptcy case. The businesses account for only about\nfour pct of Texaco's total revenues.\n    Mickey Sheinfeld, a Houston lawyer who represented\nContinental Airlines in an historic bankruptcy case that set\naside labor union agreements, said the track record of the\nbitter Texaco-Pennzoil struggle indicates that the two\ncompanies could spend two or three years fighting in bankruptcy\ncourt.\n    \"The courts have been very interested in the issue of\ngood-faith bankruptcy filings. This may prove to be a landmark\ncase in developing that issue,\" Sheinfeld said.\n    Texaco, he said, was following the example set by Manville\nCorp, A.H. Robins Co and other firms that fell into bankruptcy\nexpressly to avoid paying large legal judgments. Bankruptcy\nlaws were relaxed in 1978 so that a company no longer needed to\nprove it was insolvent in order to seek protection from\ncreditors.\n    Texaco lawyers bristle at the suggestion that the company\nentered bankruptcy to spite Pennzoil.\n    Gibson Gayle, a Texaco lawyer, said the company had every\nright to seek protection from creditors, and that Texaco had\nembarked on an internal restructuring plan in December 1984\nthat required transferring various assets among subsidiaries.\nBut Treece said the high profile of the Texaco bankruptcy case\nmay also put the company under an uncomfortable spotlight.\n    \"What seems fair and what may be legally correct may be two\nentirely different things,\" Treece said. \"This may be a signal\nto Congress to do something about tightening the bankruptcy\nlaws. You are either a chicken or a duck, just like you are\neither bankrupt or you're not.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The money could be spent on\nproducts which would have a more direct impact in boosting\ndomestic growth, it added.\n    \"There's a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo\nsaid. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"\n    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector\namount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent\nestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37\nbillion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.\n    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm\non weekends to put their land up for sale for residential\ndevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,\neconomists said.\n    \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the\nexpansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor\nat Kyoto Gakuen University.\n    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform\nto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic\nrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the\nfarm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really\nwant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to\nraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei\nOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'\nAssociations told a recent press conference.\n    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek\nremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade\ndeficits with Japan.\n    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well\nentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.\n    Although the full-time farm population is falling and there\nare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban\nconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on\nfarm votes in the rural areas.

Gonzalez also disclosed\nthat banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrs\nin the form of a bearer bond. \"We expect to complete the\npackage very quickly,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n    By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in new\nmoney being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearer\nbond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smaller\nbanks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.\n    The bonds, currently dubbed \"alternative participation\ninstruments,\" would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan\n- a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate margin\nof 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.\n    The idea of the \"exit bond\" is that a creditor bank may\nexchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,\ntradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.\n    In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debt\nconverted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure for\npurposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.\n    Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks would\ntake up the \"exit bonds\" because no such instrument has been\noffered before.\n    On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate could\nshrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350\ncreditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.\n    Details of the \"exit bonds\" are still being finalized,\nGonzalez added.\n    Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of the\nlending process because it has bitter memories of its last\npackage, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steering\ncommittee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.\n    Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in the\nlatest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which was\nannounced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina on\nthe road to meeting its economic goals.\n    \"We believe this is a package that will help Argentine to\ncontinue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growth\nand equilibrium in the external accounts,\" he said.\n    Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in the\nfinal stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent \"practical\nsupport.\"\n    He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressed\nfor an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouille\nthreatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of the\nInternational Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banks\nstopped blocking a deal.\n    The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspending\ninterest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, who\nhave long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.\n    \"That was a feeling among people on the committee,\" one\nbanker said.\n    As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the same\ninterest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the rescheduling\nof 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this would\nraise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8\npct on recent rescheduling packages.\n    Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government,\nwhich promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of\n13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between the\nPhilippines and the banks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Another, referring to the Philippine debt\nnegotiators, said \"The only reason they'd have to come back to\nNew York is political, not economic.\"\n    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra\n1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.\n    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's anger\ngoes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personally\nbetrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was a\nrock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.\nTreasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.\n    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. to\npress his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisory\ncommittee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, to\nnegotiate the spread reduction by telex.\n    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start\npaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the\ncommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than\nMexico and Argentina, the source said.\n    \"The Philippines really means business on this. I don't\nthink there's much room for compromise,\" he said.\n    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.\n    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule\n10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of\n7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt\nwill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.\n    Bankers said they were forced to break their word because\npolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.\n    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentina\nwas serious about its threat to suspend interest payments\nunless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratorium\nwould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which has\nalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of the\nReagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.\n    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, the\nrich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it\nattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.\n    \"When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, they\nmay realize that this is not a Mexican deal,\" one banker said\nof the Argentine agreement.\n    The Argentine pact contains several features that were not\nin the Mexican accord such as \"exit bonds,\" an option to\nprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlending\nprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.\n    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs in\nnew loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying\n7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct charged\nto Mexico.\n    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, who\nnote drily that they asked for no new money at all.\n    \"The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina\nand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they're\ngoing to have problems with both the Philippines and\nVenezuela,\" said the source close to the Manila government.\n    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an\nofficial reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pct\non its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledged\nthat Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread was\ninviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.\n    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.\n    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, the\ngovernment of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract\nattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt\npackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.\n    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines will\nalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 tough\nmonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The\ntariffs were placed on items which were available from other\nsources so there would be little effect on the American\nconsumer, Fitzwater said.\n    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action\n- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade\npractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.\n    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.\n    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion\ndlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about\none-third of America's overall deficit.\n    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West\nGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the\npresident is ready to fight them all.\n    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret\nthat these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and\nvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to\nAmerican competitiveness in world markets.\n    \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading\npractices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California\nvacation home at Santa Barbara.\n    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan\nabided by the agreement.\n    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -\nwhich is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he\nalready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.\n    The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't\ndone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade\npractice.\"\n    The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an\nexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fight\nunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major\noverall of our trade laws.\"\n    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not\nin the best interests of the United States, and that\nnegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.\n    \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he\nsaid, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in\ntrade.\"\n    Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\npolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impact\non Congress.\"\n    He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n    But other analysts said it made little difference whether\nthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\nand that the main point was that the trading partners were on\nnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n    Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\nimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\nit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n    Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\npolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impact\non Congress.\"\n    He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n    But other analysts said it made little difference whether\nthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\nand that the main point was that the trading partners were on\nnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n    Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\nimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\nit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The bank's new private sector division\nin 1986 approved three loans totalling 11.46 mln dlrs without\ngovernment guarantees.\n    In addition, the ADB approved four equity investment\nprojects totalling 8.15 mln dlrs.

The\nU.S. Complained in 1986 the ADB was granting bad loans in its\nimpatience to hit lending targets.\n    \"I suspect there is some arm-twisting,\" he said.\n    \"I find some developed countries are more interested in the\nprocurement side instead of the development side.\"\n    Fujioka said he said he foresaw increased sectoral lending\nand a gradual dilution of the ADB's project-tied lending.\n    Fujioka said project lending was expected to drop to 63 pct\nof total loans in 1987, from 66.5 pct in 1986 and 77.5 pct in\n1985.

It suggests\nliberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports\nof Indian goods by making them more competitive.\n    The summary said, \"These reforms would result in (domestic)\nprices much more in line with world prices than is true today,\nand in a greater degree of import competition and export\nrivalry than the nation has ever seen.\"\n    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in\nIndia's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal\nimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and\nexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports\nwould provide the foreign exchange for imports.\n    \"The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present\nprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenously\navailable products and to recognise the role of actual or\npotential competition from imports as a source of discipline on\nthe prices and costs of public and private sector domestic\nmanufacturers,\" the summary said.\n    An Indian official told Reuters the government was\ndiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some\nchanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give\nfurther details.\n    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's\nfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss\naid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.\n    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew\nat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and\n1986/87, which ended in March.\n    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of\ngdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by\nnational savings, mainly from the private sector.\n    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed\nto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96\nbillion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to\n2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.\n    But the summary said the improvement was largely due to\nlower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers\nwhich make up the bulk of India's import bill.\n    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign\nexchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the\nsummary said.\n    The Bank's summary said there was little room for\ncomplacency in the balance of payments position.\n    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,\nIndian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.\n    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a\nyear in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable\nbalance of payments, the summary said.\n    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.\nIndia \"might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while\nundertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that\ninvolve some political costs,\" it said.\n    \"An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an\nexchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,\"\nthe summary said.\n    It said such an approach had been successful in countries\nsuch as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey.
