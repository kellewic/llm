The\nstockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\n    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\nthe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\n    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\nand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\n    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\nmanagement was counter-productive, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

And\neconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore,\" said a\ndealer at one major U.S. bank.\n    As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the\nyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,\nFederal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the\nmarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency.\n    Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar\nrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from\nthe post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still\nfailed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.\n    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5\nbillion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars\nyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.\n    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the\nFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen\ntoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased\na small amount of dollars for yen.\n    The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28\nwhen it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of\nJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have\nsignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.\n    The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February\n22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\nFrance and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate\nto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.\n    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by\nthe authorities' intervention which they said can only soften\nextreme moves in the market.\n    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's\npurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than\nfor the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  \nwatered-down American commitment to the currency accord.\n    The Bank of England's action also was thought to be\ncompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing\nthe market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six\nnations in its support of the currency pact.\n    \"No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other\ntwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures than\nanything else,\" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.\n    \"I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,\" said\nEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. \n\"It's a yen problem more than anything else.\"\n    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist\nsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American\nauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.\n    \"The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the\nTreasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on\nits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,\"\nsaid Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.\n    Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets\nare becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official\ndenials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a\nlower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.\n    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade\ndeficit in 1986 was with Japan.\n    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on\nSunday that the February currency pact had not established\ndollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the\nU.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.\n    \"The dollar still has more room on the downside against the\nyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The\ncurrency market is becoming very political,\" said Natsuo Okada\nof Sumitomo Bank Ltd.\n    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen\nthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end\nof April or early May.\n    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their\neconomies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic\nimbalances in the near future, dealers said.\n    \"Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it\nwon't be enough to help the trade situation much,\" said\nBourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to\n148 yen in the next couple of days.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

A\nsevere drought that summer in major producing states caused\nyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2\nbillion bushels.\n    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts\nsaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion\nbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.\n    \"This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant\nreduction in production,\" an analyst said.\n    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.\ncorn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not\nincrease significantly, a specialist said.\n    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the\ngreatest acreage reductions, based upon historical\nparticipation in government programs, analysts said.\n    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most\nin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western\ncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.\n    \"Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,\"\nhe said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in\nhigher-producing delta areas.\n    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's\n2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.\n    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in\n1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has\nsteadily declined in the 1980's.\n    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in\nthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The\nhighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has\nkept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln\nacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.\n    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields\naveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.\n    \"We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion\nbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,\" an analyst said.\n    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as\nlong as government program provisions remain the same, analysts\nsaid.\n    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to\nset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible\nfor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15\npct of their acreage.\n    \"To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to\nprovide more incentives,\" an analyst said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS", "body": "Automobile dealerships have become\nlarge, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1\nbillion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.\n    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and\nbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the\nlargest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts\nsay.\n    Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There's not\nmuch that's off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about\nways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University\nof Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.\n    The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it\nwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit\nanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.\n    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.\nDealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a\nStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold\n738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National\nAutomobile Dealers Association.\n    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen\nBeatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a\nrebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from\nrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,\nsays Jauppi.\n    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has\nbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,\nthe average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold\nincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers.\n    \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln\ndlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,\"\nsays Cole.\n    \"There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that\nmake cars,\" he says.\n    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying\nup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend\nwill let up.\n    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.\nPower, a California-based market research firm, says that, by\n1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800\nprincipal owners today.\n    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several\nfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It\nused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a\nChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.\n    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about\nthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned\nor open international operations.\n    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,\n\"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.\n    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way\nof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to\ntrading in car dealer shares.\n    \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing\nthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those\ncars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.\n    \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the\nscale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to\nresist taking them public,\" said another analyst.\n    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become\ninternational.\n    \"We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks\nthat are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted\nparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster\nthan the U.S., he says.\n    \"It's not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES", "body": "Middle East currency dealers meet in\nAbu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their\nbusiness, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from\nthe Arab world to London.\n    The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association\nalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf\ncurrency system is more real that at any time this decade.\n    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these\nissues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to\nbe major talking points.\n    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --\nincluding some in London and other major non-Arab financial\ncentres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins\non on Saturday.\n    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a\ngrowing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,\nby far the largest in the region, is being carried out in\nLondon.\n    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,\nforeign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in\nBahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based\nbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London.\n    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade\nfinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain\nran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.\nClearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.\n    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, <Arab\nBanking Corp> and <Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased\ntheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading\nrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.\n    One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in\nLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...\nThere is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\"\n    Jeddah-based <Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit\ntaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,\n<National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November\n1986.\n    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based\nconsortium bank <Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom\njoint-venture <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its\nLondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.\n    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the\nvolume of business in London has gained pace with the two new\nlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most\nof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\"\n    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi\nriyal market is difficult to quantify.\n    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency\ndeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped\nto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986\nfrom 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.\n    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal\ntrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very\nquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now\nstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect\n<Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.\n    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market\nmoving completely out of the region, partly because of local\ndemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate\ninternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue\nspeculation.\n    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market\nshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain\nand London is still limited.\n    But for the first time since the formation of the six\nnation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs\nthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.\n    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final\ncurrency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary\nSystem style with a common peg have been discussed at high\nlevel and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected\nto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.\n    One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to\ndiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the\nend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\n    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\n    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\nsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently\nlinked to a basket of currencies while the other five\ncurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to the\nU.S. Dollar.\n    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation\nagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,\nbut plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of\n7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.\n    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued\nslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the\nundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

(and\nissue) excessive wage and bonus increases,\" he said.\n    Failure to cut this excess will \"result in reduced\naccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,\"\nZhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low per\ncapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.\n    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction\nin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption\nmust match the available resources, he said.\n    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986\nbecause of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost\nof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income\nfrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.\n    Local authorities, departments and firms have been able to\nretain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. \"(They)\nunjustifiably developed processing industries and\nnon-productive construction,\" Zhao said.\n    He said that unless effective measures are taken to curb\nthis practice, financial and credit deficits are likely to\nincrease in the next few years.\n    Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last\ntoo long, they will cause the over-issue of money, which in\nturn will cause \"disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise in\ncommodity prices and chaos in economic life.\"\n    Another serious problem is that too many new construction\nprojects have been launched. Fixed asset investment outside the\nstate plan is over-extended and the pattern of such investment\nis highly irrational, he said.\n    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw\nand semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and\ninvestment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.\n     Zhao said some departments and local authorities have\nfailed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this\ninvestment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from the\nState Council earlier this year.\n     He said China's per capita output of grain and other farm\nand sideline products is still very low and production of\ngrain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a\nrather weak foundation.\n     China's countryside is still in the development stage and\nthere is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, he\nsaid, but did not elaborate.\n    Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe\nlife into China's large and medium sized state firms, which\nstill do not have \"a satisfactory combination of\nresponsibilities, powers and benefits.\"\n    \"We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises\nfull managerial authority and full responsibility for their own\nprofits and losses,\" he said.\n    Currently, the firms are not responding rationally to\nmarket changes and doing all the state requires of them, he\nsaid. Their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.\n    Zhao said that in 1987, China will speed up the reform of\nits financial system, diversify credit services, encourage\ncompetition among different financial institutions and promote\ninsurance services.\n    He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed,\nwith differential and floating rates being applied for\ndifferent periods of time.\n    China must, under proper guidance, develop markets for the\ncirculation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of\nfinancial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.\n    Zhao said China must also expand the market for capital\ngoods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber.

Headquarters in\nNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter\ninto force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting\nfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.\n    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said\nthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of\nliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber\nand a possible depression of prices.\n    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to\nkeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose\nor fell through its buffer stock system.\n    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of\npurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a\ncontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done\nthrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.\n    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to\nfinance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed\nwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may become\nindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International\nTin Agreement.\n    \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out\nwithout any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said.\n     Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking\ncabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers\nand consumers would also become members, he said.\n    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit\nto Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.\n    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because\nits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.\n    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new\npact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt\nthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market\noperations.\n     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free\nrubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at\nlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.\n    \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable\nlevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,\nwhile producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian\nRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.\n    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the\noverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had\npsychologically prevented price rises, he said.\n    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had\nbeen depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a\nbuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.\n    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was\nexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.\n    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be\npressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to\nstabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers\nto produce more.\n    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's\nconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to\nallow sharp price fluctuations in future.\n    \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be\nliquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said.\n    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success\nas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they\nquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers\nto finance buffer stock operations.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "LONDON ON RISE AS TRADING CENTRE IN U.S. DEBT", "body": "London's rise as a trading centre for\nU.S. Government debt has been spurred by the increasing use of\ninterest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues\nin the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.\n    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all\nnew debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth\n-- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.\n    \"The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap-driven,\" said David\nJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international and\nhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.\n    \"It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in\n10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest\nrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal,\" Jones said at a recent\nconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.\n    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going\nthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.\n    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in\nU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the\ndirection of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided\nthe sole source of new business.\n    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving\ntwo and 10-year Treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.\n    The trade, they said, was swap related.\n    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasury\ndebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.\n    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.-based research firm which\ndrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that gross\ntransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to\n341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,\nagainst 188 billion in all of 1985.\n    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasury\ntrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming the\nthird major centre.\n    And while figures are not yet available for the last\nquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend\ncontinued, traders say.\n    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, put\naverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15\nbillion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ\nSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.\nGovernment bonds which has offices in London, New York and\nTokyo.\n    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ's competitor,\nFundamental Brokers Inc's London operations, estimates average\ndaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.\n    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries trading\nvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.'s own government\nbonds, known as gilts.\n     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust International\nLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediaries\nin swap transactions to lock in the \"spread,\" the difference\nbetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate\nthat the counterparty is obliged to pay.\n    But even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the\nnature of trading in London has changed.\n    \"The interesting thing our figures show is the transition in\nLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort,\" said Louis\nCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting the\ndata.\n    Crandall said that previously, firms' activities were\nlimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to European\ninvestors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing act\nas principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf of\ntheir New York offices.\n    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profit\nand loss sheets for their London operations so that trading\ndecisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.\n    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch and\nCo, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade for\ntheir own accounts here.\n    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operating\nin London has increased sharply over the past year, as has the\nnumber of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Government\nsecurities.\n    Within the past few months, National\nWestminster Bank Plc's County Bank subsidiary and Swiss Bank\nCorp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to\nbecome primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and their\nLondon offices have just recently received direct-dealing\nbrokers screens.\n    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, is\npreparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.\n    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,\nthe largest of the four major government bond brokers here,\nsaid he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from\n35 a year ago.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "UK EQUITIES SEEN DUE FOR DOWNWARD CORRECTION", "body": "The chances of U.K. Stocks continuing\nrecent rises as budget euphoria gives way to the uncertainties\nof a probable election are small, and market analysts say there\nwill probably be a downwards correction in the next few weeks.\n    The U.K. Market has managed a dizzy rise since the New\nYear, with the FT-SE index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5\npct since January 2 to current levels around 2050.\n    \"Over the next month or two the odds are that the index will\ndrop back to around 1,900,\" said John Goldschmidt, head of\nequities research at Chase Manhattan Securities.\n    \"A five to 10 pct drop is likely. There was a six pct fall\nbefore the 1983 election when the Conservatives were further\nahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14\ninstead of 18 now,\" noted Nick Knight of brokers James Capel.\n    \"The old adage is \"sell in May and go away'. That's likely to\napply this year but will probably start in April,\" he added.\n    But few analysts believed a correction would spell the end\nof the bull run that has now lasted for some six years.\n    \"As long as corporate profits and earnings keep on growing\nthen the pressure for continued rises will be there. There\nseems little prospect of the growth stopping in 1987/1988,\" one\nsaid.\n    Much of the recent enthusiasm has stemmed from the belief,\nalready virtually discounted, that the ruling Conservatives\nwill call an election in the next few months - probably June -\nand sweep home to a third term in office.\n    Even if this does happen, however, pre-election nerves are\nlikely to produce the traditional effect of damping down the\nmarket until the result is clear.\n    \"It's likely there will be one or two hiccups of confidence\nabout the Tories winning an overall majority,\" Goldschmidt said.\n    \"It would be quite out of character for the market to\ncontinue to sail serenely upwards right through the election\nand beyond,\" added brokers Phillips and Drew in a recent report.\n    The belief that the government itself is worried about the\nimpact of the Alliance party disrupting the usual two-corner\nfight of Conservative and Labour with unpredictable results, is\nnot likely to give reassurance, one analyst noted.\n    Other factors also indicate that the market is vulnerable\nto a downwards correction. U.K. Stocks had ridden up partly on\nthe back of record rises in New York and Japan and a pause in\neither suggests that London would inevitably follow suit.\n    There would also be little new encouragement provided by\ngeneral economic factors as much of the recent optimistic news,\nincluding this month's half point cut in base rates to 10 pct,\nis already built into prices.\n    \"The economy is looking okay, but it can't support 20 pct\nincreases every three months indefinitely,\" one said.\n    Also, market liquidity, a powerful driving force behind the\nrecent rises, shows signs of drying up under the pressure of\nthe government's privatisation campaign.\n    The next few months will see cash calls for second tranche\npayments on British Gas Plc <BRGS.L> and British Airways Plc\n<BAB.L> as well as the proposed sale of <Rolls Royce Plc> and\nthe as-yet untimetabled sale of the government's 31.7 pct stake\nin British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.\n    On top of that, there will be calls from the gilt market\neven though last week's budget limited the projected 1987/88\nborrowing requirement to four billion stg.\n    \"We are looking for a squeeze on cash flow, and that's not\nincluding rights issues which have been low so far this year\nand may pick up in the second quarter,\" Knight said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "ENERGY/U.S. OIL OUTPUT", "body": "Energy Secretary John Herrington has\nproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said\nall would cost the Treasury money and will come under close\nWhite House scrutiny before action is taken.\n    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion\nallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as\nproduction using enhanced extraction methods.\n    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.\nThe White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the\ntax code, but would look at the proposal.\n    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along\nwith the release last week of the energy department's report on\nenergy and the national security.\n    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit\n50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging\nimplications for national security.\n    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that\nany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production\nwould have to meet three criteria--increase production, not\ncause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.\n    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,\nspurring production but fail the second and third.\n    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil \nworkers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil\nprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide\nand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.\n    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria\nby not increasing domestic production.\n    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains\nfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.\n    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:\n    - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by\nborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if\noil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that\ncould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.\n    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It\nwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000\nbarrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.\n    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical\nexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a\nday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.\n    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to\nspur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for\nthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower\nthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.\n    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration\nproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut\nthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.\n    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore\noff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion\nbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which\nmay hold nine billion barrels.\n    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to \namend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these\nproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security\nstudy would make a strong case for the need to help the\nstruggling domestic oil industry.\n    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even\nthough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to\nraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to\n100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.\n    This, he said, would further bolster national security in\ncase of an oil-supply disruption.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Huckaby, chairman\nof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar\nissues, told Reuters in an interview.\n    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year\nthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver the\nsame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also\nsaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.\n    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic\nsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further\ncuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.\n    \"I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)\nanother half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point\nwhere the program might not work,\" he said.\n    \"Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,\"\nsaid Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.\n    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the\ncurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the\nU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports\nholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.\n    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made\nuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.\n    \"I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could\nprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through\nthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\"\nHuckaby said.\n    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup\nproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener\nmarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.\n    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will\ncapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in\nthe U.S.\n    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the\nproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further\nexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports\nmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.\n    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner\ncompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.\n    \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have\nsome natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the\nprogram is preserved,\" Huckaby said.\n    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to\nthink about how domestic output could be controlled, either\nthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.\n    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the\nJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask\ncorn refiners to limit production.\n    \"I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do\nthere's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do\nthat legally?\" he said.\n    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without\nthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragile\nhouse if you do it that way.\"\n    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers\nhave expanded production, because high sugar price support\nmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such\nas soybeans and grain.\n    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would\nnot be good policy.\n    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to\nsugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they\nmay be penalized retroactively under any production control\nlegislation passed next year.\n    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in\nthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration\nproposal to drastically slash the program.\n    \"The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't\nthink it will get up a head of steam,\" Huckaby said.\n    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price\nsupport is unlikely to be approved.\n    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,\nHuckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint\nwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the\nEuropean Community's sugar policy.

Trump said his interest in\nthe stock was as an investment, but the executive said the\ncompany does not know how much Trump owns or whether he has any\nother plans.\n    UAL senior vice president Kurt Stocker said the company\nbelieves its diversification strategy will work since it can\nfeed customers from one business to another. Several weeks ago,\nit announced the new name of Allegis, to be taken in May.\n    \"The strategy that Dick Ferris was talking about a couple\nweeks ago when we announced the Allegis name is that the whole\nreally ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts.\nUnfortunately, some people haven't really come to this\nunderstanding,\" Stocker said.\n    But those same parts - Westin Hotels, Hertz rental cars,\nUnited Airlines and its reservation system - also has Wall\nStreet calculating a wide range of breakup values from about\n100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.\n    Analysts aren't so sure the strategy is going to work. They\nmention Transworld Corp, initially Trans World Airlines,\nas an example of an airline diversification gone wrong.\nTransworld Corp ended up spinning off its TWA airline.\nTransworld, now TW Services, is selling Hilton International to\nUAL.\n    \"If you want to be negatively biased you say it's a stupid\nphilosophy, and if you're United and you put billions of dlrs\ninto other acquisitions, this is a good idea. There's not much\nevidence one way or the other,\" said Dean Witter analyst Mark\nDaugherty.\n    \"In the short or long run, they all (UAL's businesses) make\nmoney and perform well,\" said Stocker.

Louis Marckesano of\nJanney Montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.\n    \"They're potential is enormous. I think their problem has\nbeen execution. The strike was the single biggest factor that\nset them back in 1985. Last year, the whole industry was\ninvolved in fare wars. They were hit harder by the fare wars\nthan anyone else,\" said Marckesano.\n    Marckesano said United Airlines was particularly hurt by\nthe fare wars because it shares a Denver hub with Texas Air\nCorp's price-slashing Continental Airlines.\n    Analysts said the same strategy which has contributed to an\nundervalued stock price may also result in a strong takeover\ndefense. They said UAL paid a lot for some of its assets and\nthat in itself may make the company undesireable.\n    \"I think they have a fairly tough management that will at\nleast be able to do battle with a potential shark and may well\nbe able to defeat them. These guys aren't pushovers,\" said\nSteve Lewins, an airline analyst at Citicorp.\n    Lewins believes the company could ultimately boost the\nstock price to a level that would reflect its assets, but it\nwill take time and improvements in earnings.\n    \"If they put their nose to the grindstone, we're talking\nabout years for anyone (in the airline industry),\" he said.\n\"The whole unwinding of the battle of Texas Air is going to\ntake years, establishing the Pacific in competition with (NWA\nInc <NWA>) Northwest is going to take until 1990,\" Lewins said.\n     UAL today rose 2-1/2 to 62-1/2 on heavy volume of 1.9 mln\nshares.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

More than 50 pct of the banks must give their\napproval, and Nogales said he is confident that this threshold\nwill be reached.\n    \"It's working out very well, and I think we'll get clear\nmajority,\" Nogales said.\n    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banks\nare responding positively and said all the legal waivers\nnecessary could be obtained within two months.\n    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in\nMarch 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spending\ntrimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on the\ndollar on the secondary market and many banks have written off\nmost, if not all, of their loans to the country.\n    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery in\nBolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what\nthey can on the loans.\n    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a\nmarket price.

Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.\n    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops\ninstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,\nNogales said.\n    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four\npct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased\nto pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n\nimpact on inflation, he added.\n    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase to\nbecome a model for other debtors in dire straits. \"We're not\nseeking a universal solution,\" he said.\"             \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Certs can be used to\nrepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or\ncash.\n    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion\ndlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another\n6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and\nAugust 1987, according to USDA.\n    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily\nbecause recipients can use the certificates to pay back\ngovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.\n    Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would save\nthe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to\nthe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according\nto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates\ncost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.\n    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be\nconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other\nsavings alternatives.\n    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the\nestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date\nhave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln\ndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one\nadministration official said.\n    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates\nbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.\n    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable\nto the different effect certificates can have on market prices\nover the course of a crop year.\n    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found\nthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of\ncorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by\nbetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.\n    Between September and November, however, certificates had\nonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS\nstudy, obtained by Reuters.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

We are exceedingly profitable,\" a\nspokesman for the firm told Reuters.\n    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than any\nother broker, have involved concerns that its business will be\nthreatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. The\nfirm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers business\nand had ties to now-disgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.\n    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that some\ncommodities firms have begun to limit the amount of business\nthey will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel has\nlong been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.\n    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters that\nDrexel's overall business is proceeding normally and the\nfirst-quarter profit \"could be the strongest of anybody on Wall\nStreet.\"\n    \"I wouldn't say we're not feeling any effect (from the\ntrading probes),\" he said. \"But we're doing extremely well.\"\n    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in the\ngovernment's wide-ranging probe of illegal trading involving\nthe use of confidential company information on Wall Street.\n    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexel's \"junk\nbond\" operation -- the issuance of high-risk speculative debt\nthat it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.\n    \"We have done nothing wrong,\" said the Drexel spokesman.\n\"After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence of\nany wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm.\"\n    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boesky\narrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual at\nthe firm been charged with illegal acts while employed by\nDrexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, was\ncharged in connection with a former job.\n    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel has\nsuffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. To\nbegin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in the\njunk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexel\nmight be in trouble.\n    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bank\nrefused to allow Drexel-issued bonds as collateral on credit\nlines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.\n    The company also was notified last month that the outside\ninsurer of Drexel's individual brokerage accounts had decided\nnot to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiary\nhandling part of the insurance. American International Group\nand a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.\n    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in the\nmergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.\nHowever, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel had\nlost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.\nBut in citing results for the quarter, the company points\nmostly to other areas of success.\n    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including\n3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the January-March period,\nDrexel said. Drexel maintains the lion's share of this\nlucrative business, trade sources noted.\n    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, \"has rallied\nback with a vengeance,\" Anredder said.\n    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,\nmarket sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.\n    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limiting\nhead-to-head dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets \nbased on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexel\nspokesman called this \"ridiculous.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The discussion is\nnow on pricing (of just the cash payments),\" he said.\n    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the\nPhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8\nover the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would\nnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.\n    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement\nmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more than\nthree weeks.\n    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8\nover LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,\ndollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially\nyield up to one point over LIBOR.\n    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at\nleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had\ngrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other\nlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.\n    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a\nseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund their\nown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the\nsecondary market, Ongpin said.\n    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full\nface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments\nat any time prior to their six-year maturity date.\n    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs\nproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of\ncertain investment banks which are already active in the\nsecondary market for sovereign debt.\n    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs\nwould include no government fees and would be free from\n\"administrative hassles.\"\n    He said about six investment banks had been approached and\nfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45\nmln dlrs worth of notes, he said.\n    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in\nthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines\ncould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign\nexchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring\nperiod.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TOKYO EARTHQUAKE AFTERSHOCKS", "body": "The possibility that a major earthquake\nwill strike Tokyo, causing corporate and financial ruin, haunts\nthe worst nightmares of many insurers and bankers polled by\nReuters.\n    The Japanese capital is shaken by hundreds of small tremors\nevery year, but last week's biq quake in western Japan, which\nmeasured 6.9 on the open-ended Richter scale, was a timely\nreminder that the big one could come at any time.\n    Another on Tuesday registering a preliminary 6.5 on the\nscale struck the Sea of Japan coast northwest of Tokyo.\n    A widely accepted theory by the late seismologist Kawasumi\nHiroshi states that major quakes occur in cycles averaging 69\nyears. Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading\n7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.\n    Seismic experts at Shizuoka, one of three areas near Tokyo\nconsidered quake-prone, say they expect a major earthquake\nwithin the next few years.\n    Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nation\nhas suffered a major quake since the far-reaching changes in\nthe last two decades which have bound the global economy into a\ncomplex, fragile, interdependent financial network.\n    \"We are reaching a dangerous time. Insurance companies are\nstarting to worry about how to cover the large losses,\" said\nHatsuho Narita, a manager at the British Insurance Group.\n    \"It's a theme that has worried a lot of people. It's\ndifficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all world\nmarkets would be considerable,\" Brian Waterhouse, a banking\nexpert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo, told Reuters.\n    What would happen?\n    Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefectures\naccount for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product, or\nsome six pct of world GNP.\n    Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of\na Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because of\nthe large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London.\nBut it would plunge against other currencies.\n    This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and\nassets in the Tokyo area. Banks would be left holding hundreds\nof billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.\n    Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regional\nbanks' loan exposure is to smaller business, which would most\nlikely lose all in a quake. Up to nine pct of their exposure is\nin housing and consumer loans, they said.\n    Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to the\nwall, bankers polled by Reuters said.\n    The government, aware that insurance claims would be huge,\nhas set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. In\nTokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.\n    In addition, the insurance industry has formed the Japan\nEarthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10\nbillion dlrs, 80 pct of it government-guaranteed.\n    However, insurers said the industrial sector, which has no\ngovernment backing, is a more dangerous risk.\n    Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly\ndifficult to find reinsurance abroad.\n    \"Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurance\nrisks,\" said Tahashi Kumakiri, Foreign Department head at the\nJapan Non-life Insurance Association.\n    Due to limited world insurance capacity, the Finance\nMinistry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct of\nJapanese firms' total insurable value.\n    Even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure up\nto 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it through\nLloyds of London.\n    Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again,\ncompounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.\n    Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake cover\nbut foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.\n    Industrial cover is confidential but official figures show\nthat in fiscal 1985/86 ended March 31, Japan did about half a\nbillion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover,\nmost of which is quake-related.\n    Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and\nrepatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investment\nwould seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.\n    Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so of\nforeign bonds a month, much of it U.S. Treasuries, and are\npurchasing more and more U.S. And European stocks. The value of\nforeign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive.\n    Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long period\nto rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditors\nfrom existing capital resources, the bankers said.\n    Loss of central computers would mean billions in lost\ntransactions, bankers noted.\n    Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fell\nby up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

It was confident oil prices\nwere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the\ninvestment.\n    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management\nchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even\nin a lower oil price environment.\n    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs\nand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before\ntax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.\n    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.\nOne noted that it was not immediately clear why the group\nshould spend so much money buying a company it already\ncontrolled.\n    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard\nshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.\n    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on\nthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to\ndispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the\n1987/88 financial year, analysts said.\n    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted\nthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would\ndepend on the reaction of the markets.\n    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59\npct from 20 pct currently, he said.\n    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not\nrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard\nreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from\nits cash flow -- were good.\n    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.\n    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to\nmake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from\nproduction and its downstream activities would push it\ncomfortably into surplus.\n    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the\ndiscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had\ninadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,\nwhich was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude\noil.\n    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management\nreorganisation of Standard in the past year.\n    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was\nnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the\ntender offer, Spedding said.\n    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major\nbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well\nreceived in the markets.\n    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially\nafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division\n-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come\nstraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by\nother sectors.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

But the current\naccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus\nrecorded in February 1986.\n    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the\nFebruary current account surplus compared with January was due\nto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account\nfigures are seasonally adjusted.\n    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled\n32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986\nbut a rise of 5.5 pct against January.\n    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56\nbillion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct\ncompared with January.\n    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate\nthe real change in exports and imports in February. But for\ncomparison purposes it noted that in January the average value\nof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average\nvalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.\n    Within the current account, the services account had 300\nmln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark\nsurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark\ndeficit.\n    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in\nvalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a\nyear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,\na decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.\n    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for\nJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1\nbillion marks in the year-ago period.\n    The cumulative current account surplus for January and\nFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion\nmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.\n    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus\nreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as\nseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier\nthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against\nJanuary while export prices were unchanged.\n    \"The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend\nthat is not expected to change for several months at least,\"\nsaid an economist.

He added that the\ntarget price did not constitute a rigid floor.\n    \"What we consider an acceptable price is a price at which an\ninvestor will earn an adequate return,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the bulk of the APT's current work relates to\nthe non-performing assets of the state-owned Development Bank\nof the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank\n(PNB). The APT was set up in January.\n    SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400-odd assets that the DBP\nand the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the form\nof financial assets.\n    \"In some cases financial assets have been converted into\nphysical assets by foreclosures. They are fairly cut and dried\nbecause we are dealing with mostly whole production facilities\nlike textile or food-processing plants,\" he said.\n    \"Financial assets are more complicated. The only recourse is\nto foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but the\nlaws here tend to favour the debtors,\" he added.\n    SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecution\nby its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel with\nlitigation.\n    \"If you see some of the situations we have to work our way\nthrough you will see that our symbol, a Gordian knot, is an apt\nillustration,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16\nof the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the high\ncosts involved. \"When you do your arithmetic you realise that if\nyou did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of the\nasset's book exposure,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associates\nof former President Ferdinand Marcos, who originally owned many\nof the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through the\nprivatisation scheme.\n    \"We just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise these\nassets to the maximum degree possible,\" he said. \"We are selling\nfor cash, it is not our concern where it comes from.\"\n    He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about the\nidentities of buyers that \"Marcos cronies\" could easily put up\nlegitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from bidding\nfor assets on the block.\n    \"I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100-peso bills,\nall with identical serial numbers and they look like genuine\nlegal currency, then I would accept them',\" SyCip said.\n    He said some participants in the government's debt-equity\nswap scheme were interested in buying non-performing assets\nwith the pesos they receive from such deals. The problem is\ngovernment regulations slow down approval of debt-equity plans\nand the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days.\n    \"The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look at\ninvestment funds earmarked for non-performing asset purchases,\"\nhe said. \"It would greatly facilitate matters.\"\n    SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24\nbillion pesos of the assets' total worth of 108 billion.\n    President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month that\nproceeds from the sale of APT-controlled assets would be used\nto finance the government's land reform program, which aims to\ndistribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.\n    Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers, SyCip\nsaid: \"How much money has the country to lose because of this\n'Filipinos first' slogan? How many people have become\nmillionaires and then forgotten the Philippines and put their\nmoney in the United States or Australia?\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The rest will be used up when\nbonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billion\ndlrs from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), a mandatory pension\nsavings scheme. Workers and employers contribute a respective\n25 pct and 10 pct of a worker's salary to the CPF, which had\nfunds totalling 29.3 billion at end-1986.\n    Regular government securities issues are needed to meet the\ndemand of banks, insurance companies, other financial\ninstitutions and corporate and individual investors, Hu said.\n    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had said it\nplanned to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments\ngrossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38\nbillion dlrs of paper over the next five years.\n    Funds raised in excess of the government's budgetary needs\nwill not be channelled into increased spending, but will be\nrecycled back to the financial system, largely through the MAS,\nHu said.\n    Hu said the current government securities market is\nrudimentary, with the CPF holding three-quarters of the\noutstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurance\ncompanies holding the rest. \"The concentration of securities in\nthe hands of such long-term holders has left little scope for\ntrading activity,\" he said.\n    \"Moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, was\nnot attractive to other investors who might have been expected\nto deal more actively in the market. The infrequency of bond\nissues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for the\ndevelopment of a market,\" Hu said.\n    Hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regular\nissues of government securities will be made, initially\ncarrying terms of up to five years and market-related yields.\n    The minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds\n-- aimed at individual investors -- and 10,000 dlrs for the\ntreasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.\n    Eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken to\nmake markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.\n    Hu said while the new government securities market will be\nessentially domestic, non-residents are free to invest, but\ninterest earned will be subject to withholding tax.\n    Hu said under the new Treasury Bills (Amendment) Bill, all\nbook entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must be\nmade in records maintained by MAS.\n    Hu said that instead of physical certificates having to\ntravel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips to\nthe MAS for registration, the MAS will maintain a computerised\nsystem for updating records in a central register.\n    Commercial banks and primary and registered government\nsecurities dealers will each have two securities accounts with\nthe MAS, one for their own holdings and the other for holdings\non behalf of all their customers, Hu said.\n    All trades will be reflected daily in changes in these\naccounts, Hu said.\n    \"These institutions will in turn act as custodians of\ngovernment securities for their customers, rendering each an\nindividual accounting of his holdings.\"\n    Hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costs\nand paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destruction\nand counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency in\nhandling large volumes of transactions.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The dollar was sold anyway.\n    Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris\naccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.\n    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,\nwhich a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a\nhalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they\nnoted.\n    The situation has again raised the question of whether\nintervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge\ncurrency markets.

In the majority of cases, people had\nperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wanting\nthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.\n    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for a\nvirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy with\nthe new code.\n    However, critics complain that the agreement does not go\nfar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still be\ncircumvented by criminals.\n    \"No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself as\nmuch as the banks,\" complained Meier of the Social Democrats. \"I\nhope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper control\nfunction.\"\n    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.\n    In particular, banks will also now be required to demand\nthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worth\nof business with them, even if they do not have an account at\nthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.\n    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,\nwhich had argued for a lower limit, said the move could help\ncombat the use of banks to \"launder\" or hide the criminal origin\nof money.\n    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunal\nable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect the\ncode.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The one mln tonne upward revision in\n1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.\nThe IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to\n87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.\n    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and\ncoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln\nagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln\nrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.\n    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is\nlikely to be down from last year as low world prices and\nrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.\n    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a\ndrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There\nis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the\nIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.\n    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain\noutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the\nEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is\nexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.\n    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union\nplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln\nhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are\nlikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved\nweather and a further increase in the use of intensive\ncultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet\nmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.\n    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be\nbolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC\nsaid.\n    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at\nend\u007fof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln\ntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.\n    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln\ntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of\nanother large crop this coming season with higher output\nexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

At some time during that period all the\nproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.\n    These changes did not always result in lower export\nsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more\nthan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.\n    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention\nprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European\ncurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which\nmost export transactions are denominated, the intervention\nprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of\nsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers\nand some governments are now searching for ways to cut\nexpenditure, the report says.\n    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five\nmajor exporters declined in the period covered by the survey\nfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to\nincreased production in China and India.\n    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was\ncountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower\nacreages.\n    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per\ncent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to\nother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.\nAcreages are attributed to official incentives.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The talks have been going on for more than\nthree weeks.\n    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8\nover LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,\ndollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially\nyield up to one point over LIBOR.\n    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at\nleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had\ngrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other\nlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.\n    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a\nseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund their\nown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the\nsecondary market, Ongpin said.\n    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full\nface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments\nat any time prior to their six-year maturity date.\n    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs\nproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of\ncertain investment banks which are already active in the\nsecondary market for sovereign debt.\n    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs\nwould include no government fees and would be free from\n\"administrative hassles.\"\n    He said about six investment banks had been approached and\nfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45\nmln dlrs worth of notes, he said.\n    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in\nthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines\ncould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign\nexchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring\nperiod.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "BRITISH BANKS RESIST SIGNING MEXICO PACKAGE", "body": "British banks are resisting signing a 76\nbillion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditch\neffort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new\n7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the package.\n    Christopher Brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit,\nat Lloyds Bank Plc, said in response to a Reuter enquiry, that\nthe six major U.K. Clearing banks last week sent a telex to\nCitibank saying they would contribute what was requested\nprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the U.S.\nBanks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by\nthem.\n    Other bankers, who declined to be identified, said other\ngroups of banks particularly those in Switzerland, France and\nCanada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had not\nsent any telex to Citibank, which chairs Mexico's 13-bank\nadvisory group.\n    However, they said it was likely that if and when the\nBritish banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.\n    Under the agreement, for which the signing began on Friday,\ncommercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct of\ntheir exposure to Mexico as of August 1982. That was the date\nof the first Mexican debt crisis.\n    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement\nfor Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting\nof the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in\nWashington.\n    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is a\nmember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.\n    However, there has been considerable resistance to the\npackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and\npartly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want to\nincrease their exposure to any Latin American countries.\n    Brougham said, \"We (British banks) have always played along\nfor Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally.\"\n    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six\nclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.\n    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by National\nWestminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,\n\u007ftandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.\n    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached\n83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the\nlevel of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of\n90 pct. \"The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours,\" he said.\n    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the\nregional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they don't contribute\nto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the\nexisting loans.\n    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and\nbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.\n    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be\nexercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks to\nfind a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that the\nlarger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,\nbut so far they have resisted this.\n    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Banks\nwill come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.\n    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British\nbanks and other national groups as \"a matter of principal, and\nburden sharing\" rather than as a \"pressure tactic\" to force the\nU.S. Banks to make up their share.\n    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the\nprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.\n    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. At\nthe signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister Gustavo\nPetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.\n    \"Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will\ncontinue to be open and willing to share with them the business\nopportunities which its future growth will create,\" Petricioli\nsaid.\n    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico\nis one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their\nexposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in\nFebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.\n    On Friday, Petricioli said \"We will be a lot more\nexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that have\nsupported us.\"\n    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when other\nmajor Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt\nnegotiations.\n    Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended all\ninterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Many\nof the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already said\nthey might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and\ntake the financial losses, which could total billions of\ndollars.\n    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if the\ninterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.\n    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened by\nregulations. In the U.K., A proposed Inland Revenue ruling\nwould affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, many\nof which are made to Latin American countries.\n    Basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank\ncan claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan\ninterest payments.\n    The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as\ntheir implementation could prove extremely costly, not just in\nterms of compliance but in limiting future business.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Money market sources said the market had begun\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\nFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\nDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\nprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\nChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\non imported goods.\n    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\nhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\nConfederation of British Industry.\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\nJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\nHarwood said.\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\nabout the figures evaporated.\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\nto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\nthan the European low of 1.5960.\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\nConservative government's support was slipping.\n    The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\nsupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\nAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\npct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\nwhose own support fell from 38 pct.\n    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\nenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\nthe voters indifferent, political observers said.\n    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\nthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\n    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which\nare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\ngeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\nHarwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\nrelief,\" he said.\n    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\nthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\nencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\nlower rates have been curtailed.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it\nwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\"\n    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground\nfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments\nof growth and inflation, economists said.\n    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the\nBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,\nraising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the\nmedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.\n    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move\nthat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.\n    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,\nthe IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is\ndemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the\npresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.\n    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is\noffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give\na two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this\nyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.\n    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest\nunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the\nbenchmark for settlements in other industries such as the\npublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations\nbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by\nearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.\n    Though many economists said the unions' current warning\nstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and\nwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week\nstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on\ntheir positions and there could still be conflict.\n    This could extend the length of time in which the\nBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.\n    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the\nprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative\nhousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.\n    \"The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this\nsquarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said.\n    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall\nunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than\nhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle\nto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.\n    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in\nsouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours\nyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and\naerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.\n    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in\nwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.\n    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates\nwould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on\na politically-inhibited Bundesbank.\n    About eight billion marks were coming into the market\ntomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.\n    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer\nto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,\nanticipating still lower rates before the month-end.\n    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers\nwas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of\nliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,\nperhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.\n    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average\n52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first\n24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA", "body": "The U.S. Agriculture Department \nformally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to\ndrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers\nfor the cut with targeted income payments.\n    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying\nthe \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers,\nDeputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration\nwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning\nwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.\n    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the\ngovernment for the price support cut with targeted income\npayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would\ncost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.\n    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be\nintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.\nJohn Porter, R-Ill.\n    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it\nis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because\npolitically-influential sugar and corn growers\nand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.\n    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration \ntargets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually\nlowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment\nany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.\n    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower\nwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3\ncts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.\n    The income payments would be based on the amount of\ncommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985\nor 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.\n    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes\nin the sugar program because the current high price support is\ncausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.\n    He said the current program has artificially stimulated\ndomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed\ncorn sweeteners to make market inroads.\n    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\n\"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one\nmln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar\nrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.\n    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives\noverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a\ncompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of\nsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing\nfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.\n    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on\nU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said\nconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than\nnecessary for sugar.\n    \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between\nsweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse\nimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently\nfacing,\" Myers said.\n    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per\nlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons\nrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to\ncompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.\n    QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991\nFirst 350 tons         6.000    4.500     3.000     1.500\nOver 350 to 700        5.750    4.313     2.875     1.438\nOver 700 to 1,000      5.500    4.125     2.750     1.375\nOver 1,000 to 1,500    5.000    3.750     2.500     1.250\nOver 1,500 to 3,000    4.500    3.375     2.250     1.125\nOver 3,000 to 6,000    3.500    2.625     1.750     0.875\nOver 6,000 to 10,000   2.250    1.688     1.125     0.563\nOver 10,000 to 20,000  0.500    0.375     0.250     0.125\nOver 20,000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

He cautioned against\n\"over-dramatizing\" the day's activity, which said was more a\nreflection of fundamental strength in the markets.\n    Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw was\nmostly covering of short positions in stocks as index options\nand individual options expired. He said there could be a\ndecline early next week in the stock market.\n    \"It looked like it worked well today,\" said Howard Kramer,\nasssistant director of market regulation for the Securities and\nExchange Commission.

The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\nfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\n    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\nBolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\nnext 12 months.\n    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\nopened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\nClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\nBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\n    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\nnegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\nfinalised, had been extremely successful.\n    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\nBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\nhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\n    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\n    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\ndisbursements this year from lender countries and international\nagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\nthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\n    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\naround 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\nPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the\ncapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had\nchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net\ninflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz\nestenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited\ninflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were\nlosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on\nthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate.\n    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-\nrelated rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off\nthousands of workers in state corporations.\n    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past\nsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government \nexpects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct\ncontraction over the last six years.\n    The government is also proposing a novel solution to its\ndebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest\nhas not been paid since March, 1984.\n    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would\nmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at\nthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- \n10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank\nsteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\nthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\ncountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.\n    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\nbuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\ndeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\nto the country.\n    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\nscheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\nin Chile for the past two years.\n    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\ndebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\nprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\nas a basis for such a scheme.\n    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\nattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\ngovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amount\nof new capital in order to grow.\n    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\nthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\ninvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    The government realises that in order to remain viable,\nBolivia will need to develop new exports.\n    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\nBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,\nand gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant\nsupply in the region.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Only if Brazil has access to new loans\ncan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.\n    \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't\nmeet all its obligations,\" he said.\n    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting\ninflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the\npublic sector budget was in operational surplus.\n    But he said there was a need to spell out government\npolicy, especially on prices.\n    \"It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external\nreasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures\nmight be introduced.\n    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the\nbanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed\nby the country's creditors.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.\nand foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent\nstudy.\n    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads\nwas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will\nhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.\n    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged\nthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the\nBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid\nweakening the dollar.\n    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading\nWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.\n    \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank\nAG said.\n    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates\nonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation\nwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.\n    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already\nnearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50\npct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.\n Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to\nshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move\nwould tend to flatten the yield curve between short and\nlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the\nBundesbank lowered its discount rate.\n    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as\nthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow\ngrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.\n    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West\nGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to\nmeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may\nforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must\nbe filled by higher government borrowing.\n    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit\nremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.\n    Economists said it appeared the government had already\nstepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from\nother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than\nexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.\n    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German\nIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987\ntax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the\nWest German government in November.\n    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.\nBut coupled with other factors such as waning foreign\nspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long\nterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.\n    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to\nincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.\n    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in\n1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.\n    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased\nborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he\nwas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as\nraising indirect taxes.\n    But few economists believe the government will be able to\ngo through with its tax measures without increasing net\nborrowing.\n    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was\nwrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986\ncould be managed without increasing deficits.\n    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed\na large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final\nquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.\n    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of\nthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion\nmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it\nhad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Under the pact, Tokyo agreed\nto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to\nincrease its imports of American semiconductors.\n    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by\nselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost\nAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory\naction.\n    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese\nchip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost\ndomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.\n    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit\ndynamic random access and erasable programmable read only\nmemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a\ncutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the\nyear.\n    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of\nchips available for export through unregulated distributors in\nthe so-called grey market.\n    \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is\ndiminishing.\"\n    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI\ncalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,\nNEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said.

The annual report was released as the Bank's\nannual meeting is being held in Miami.\n    Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countries\nwill discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan\nveto power from the current majority to 35 pct.\n    Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan\nit did not like with the assistance of only one other country.\n    The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new\nfinancing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the\nLatin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration\nto control the agency's critical loans.\n    The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power\nalthough it believes the bank's largest contributors should\nhave greater influence within the institution.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

We plan to do\nmore,\" said Mangan, director of corporate financing.\n    Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three price\nlevels to attract a wide range of retail investors and small\nregional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Inc\nand PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.\n    \"We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,\"\nMangan said.\n    \"GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get their\nthoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where the\nsecurities were placed,\" the GMAC officer added.\n    Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three different\npricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow at\nattractive rates. \"GMAC saved some basis points with this\ntechnique,\" said an officer on Korth's syndicate desk.\n    \"Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not made\nsense, obviously we would not have done it,\" Mangan noted.\n    The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.\n    For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes,\nthe offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points over\ncomparable Treasury securities.\n    Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yield\nof 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchases\nof more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20\nto yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.\n    In contrast, Ford Motor Co's <F> Ford Motor Credit Co unit\nlast month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced to\nyield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.\n    \"Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,\"\nsaid an officer on PaineWebber's corporate syndicate desk.\n\"They have to buy the securities in the secondary market.\"\n    Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par in\nthe secondary market this year. They attributed this to a huge\nnumber of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.\n    \"Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of their\nholdings called away. They're scrambling to replace them,\" said\none trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investors\nwould gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuries\nif they could buy debt issues at or below par.\n    \"The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retail\ninvestors,\" commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.\n    GMAC's Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securities\nthat were aimed at the retail sector.\n    \"Access to retail investors was the driving force behind\nthe multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so to\nspeak,\" Mangan said.\n    \"There is a lot of GMAC paper out there,\" the executive\nadded, referring to the unit's past offerings. \"One of our\nbasic strategies is to target securities to specific investors\nand hopefully attain a broader distribution.\"\n    Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes were\nselling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold out\nby Friday afternoon.\n    \"In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions,\nyou have to make a lot more telephone calls,\" an investment\nbanker pointed out.\n    Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along with\nco-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strong\nretail bases. \"They can carve out a niche here,\" one said.\n    \"We plan to underwrite more of these deals,\" said a Korth\nofficial. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.\n    Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle on\nWall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firm\nunderwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago for\nCiticorp <CCI>.\n    GMAC's Mangan said his company issued through Korth in\nOctober 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two different\nprice levels.\n    \"But the price gap between the first and second tier was\nlarge,\" Mangan said. In our conversations with the\nunderwriters, we thought three different tiers would make more\nsense because the prices would not be far apart.\"\n    Meanwhile, underwriting syndicates are scheduled to bid\ncompetitively tomorrow for 250 mln dlrs of first and refunding\nmortgage bonds due 2017 of Philadelphia Electric Co <PE>.\nNon-refundable for five years, the debt is rated Baa-3 by\nMoody's and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's.\n    Southern Railway Co, a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC>,\nwill hold accept bids on Wednesday for 20 mln dlrs of serial\nequipment trust certificates.

{"title": "TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED", "body": "Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today\nlodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its\npetition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.\n    The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,\nwhen AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed\nby banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the\ncollapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.\nAMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.\n    The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on\nthree points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of\nthe broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.\n    The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to\nwind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association\nwithin the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the\nwinding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an\narbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner\n(Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.\n    Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin\n\"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the\nnear future.

C. Olivetti and Co.\n    Industry consultants said ATT will announce a faster\naddition to its 3B line of minicomputers, improved connectivity\nproducts, a new version of its Unix software operating system\nand assortered peripheral equipment, including a laser printer.\n    The announcements, however, hold \"minimal significance\" for\nboth ATT and the industry, said Forrester Research consultant\nJohn McCarthy. \"They are just never going to be a significant\nplayer in this market as long as computers play a subjagated\nrole to the (telephone) network,\" he said.\n    ATT, the world's largest company before its breakup in 1984\nand still the pre-eminent phone company in the United States,\nhas only been able to carve out a fractional share of the\ncomputer industry.\n    Last year was particularly disastrous for the company's\ndata systems division, which posted a pre-tax operating loss\nfor the year of 1.2 billion dlrs (ATT as a whole reported a\n1986 profit of 139 mln, after a 1.7 billion dlr charge against\nearnings, down from 1.56 billion dlrs the prior year).\n    Morale is down throughout the company after ATT reduced its\nwork force by 32,000 people last year, leaving a work force of\n290,000, but analysts say the situation in the computer\ndivision is particularly bad, especially since the computer\nmerged its computer and network sales forces.\n    Meanwhile, the company's most successful product, the 6300\npersonal computer, ran out of steam in the last three months of\nthe year after gaining some five pct of the market.\n    \"ATT seemed to lose their focus with the 6300,\" said\nconsultant Norman DeWitt, president of Dataquest Inc. \"There\nwere no major product enhancements last year and a perception\ndeveloped in the marketplace that the product was tired.\"\n    Meanwhile, the 6300 had to face increasingly aggressive\ncompetition from smaller companies that undercut ATT on price\nand offered more technologically advanced machines. \"I would\nhave to say that, after a fast start, ATT just lost momentum on\nthe pc side,\" said DeWitt.\n    The 3B line of minicomputers has never found great\nacceptance in the market and ATT's Unix operating system,\nthough loved by scientists and engineers, has yet to put a\nserious dent in the much more widely used systems adopted by\nindustry giant International Business Machines Corp <IBM>.\n    By last fall, ATT executives found themselves trying to\ndefuse widespread speculation that ATT was going to abandon or\nsell off the computer division and the company turned over all\nresponsibility for personal computers to Olivetti, in which its\nowns a 23.5 pct stake.\n    But analysts said the company's image was dealt another\nblow last week when ATT senior vice president James Edwards,\nwho preceded Cassoni as head of the computer division,\nannounced he was leaving to become president of TelWatch Inc, a\nsmall developer of systems to manage networks.\n    Several other executives have also left in recent months,\nincluding John Walsh, head of the 3B minicomputer line. And,\nalthough the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experience\nrunning Olivetti's successful computer operations, analysts\nexpressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.\n    Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable success\nin both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years and\nit is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any product\nthat does not meet those profitability goals.\n     The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is that\nit may not give certain products enough time to become\nestablished and customers may be reluctant to buy a product\nthat could be discontinued in a year or two.\n    ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservative\nview of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's two\nyear goal but said he expects the data systems division to turn\naround within five years.\n    Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating \"to the\nwomb, going back to our old business\" of long distance\ntelephone systems at the expense of the computer division.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

But is\nthere a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty,\" one New\nYork banker commented.\n    Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world's\nlargest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shock\nwaves through the financial markets. But no longer.\n    Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct in\nthe immediate aftermath of Brazil's payments halt. But, in the\nEurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the most\nsensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flight\nout of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.\n    In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, in\npart or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about\n150 billion dlrs of the region's total foreign debt of 380\nbillion.\n    Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and\nNicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.\n    The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net new\nbank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time as\nbanks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result,\nexposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear for\nthe collapse of a major bank.\n    That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp <CCI>\nfelt emboldened to state early in the day that it might put\nBrazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 days\noverdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year as\na result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in\n1986 the setback would be manageable.\n    Some other banks are not as strong, however, and a\nprotracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriously\nerode depositor and investor confidence, especially if other\ndebtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.\n    Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil. Financing\nagreements were reached recently with Chile and Venezuela, an\naccord with the Philippines seems to be close at hand, and a\ndeal with Argentina on new loans and a debt restructuring could\nbe reached in the next two weeks, bankers say.\n    In taking a hard line against wholesale debt relief, the\nbanks have the clear backing of the Reagan Administration. \"All\nof us have a stake in the stability of the world banking system\n- a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also\nweakens confidence in world financial stability,\" U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker told the IADB meeting.\n    Some European bankers, however, argue that capitalization\nof interest is already happening in practice and that the banks\nought to face up to the fact and work with the debtors on\nlonger-term solutions that recognize that not all the interest\ncan be paid back right away.\n    Rigid accounting rules have prevented U.S. banks from\nseriously considering adding interest to the principal of a\nloan because they would have to declare the loan\nnon-performing. But, Brazilian central bank governor Gros said,\nif the banks are now volunteering to take that step, they might\nbe more willing to discuss new ideas for debt relief.\n    \"It's not necessarily an unfavorable development,\" Gros\nsaid when asked about the prospect of Brazilian loans being put\non a cash basis.\n    \"We find more room to discuss these things (innovations)\nwith European banks which have already bitten the bullet.\"\n     What is clear, however, is that banks are so angry and\nfrustrated with Brazil that they are in no mood to offer quick\nconcessions.\n    A long war of attrition on the debt front lies ahead.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Bernstein Co Inc said.\n    \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not\nuntil later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conference\nsponsored by the investment firm.\n    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product\nintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic\nimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.\n    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in\nmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at\n149-1/2 dlrs.\n    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company\nitself, have highlighted the external economic factors\nhampering IBM's growth.\n    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding\nthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and\npointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view.\n\"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said\nof DEC's line of VAX computers.\n    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible\nmid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\"\nwas supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range\nsystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.\n    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the\nIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should\nbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a\nrebound in its mid-range business.\"\n    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13\npct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth\nin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.\n    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming\nto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5\npct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will\ndrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.\n    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16\npct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin\nsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of\n51.3 billion dlrs.\n    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings\nand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product\nintroductions in the mid-range area.\n    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to\nDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were\ncatering largely to existing customer bases, rather than\nstealing market share from one another.\n \n Reuter\n\u0003"}

They have not given an exact figure.\n    The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in\nfixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state\nfirms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.\n    \"China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production\nwhile cutting expenditure,\" the official Peking Review said in\nan editorial yesterday.\n    \"China should institute means for the effective control of\nthe macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger\nones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and\nreduced consumption,\" it said.\n    Only by such measures, the magazine said, \"can an overall\nsupply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy\ndevelop steadily over a long period.\"\n    A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit,\nwhich he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in\nefficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and\ntaxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.\n    The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits\nand taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to\n119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget,\nlosses rose and product quality was unstable.\n    The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of\nbad management and rapid changes in external conditions.\n    \"For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free\nmarket, where prices are up to double those for materials they\nbuy under fixed quota from the state,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"The firms are not subject to proper market discipline,\nbecause they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank\nloans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them.\nUnder these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the\neconomic levers the state is introducing,\" he said.\n    Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand\nin the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of\nindustrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.\n    \"He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting\ngovernment expenditure,\" he said. \"China's economy is inherently\nunstable, either in a high or a trough.\"\n    He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since\nthe start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting\ninvestment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to\nbring demand and supply into balance.\n    \"There will be no surprises,\" the diplomat said.\n    The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was\nthe lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese\nindustrial city.\n    \"Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys\nto feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs,\nwith one banquet given by them and one given in return by me.\nBut there was none on this visit,\" he said.\n    He added economic reforms will slow this year, in\nparticular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise\nsensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues\nraise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.\n    A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about\neight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a\nnational drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning\nWestern political ideas.\n    \"In China the political system dictates economic policy,\" he\nsaid. \"The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat\nthe reformers and demand more economic austerity.\n    \"One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week\n1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less\noverseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be\nsourced internally.\"\n    The banker said he is more comfortable about China's\nstability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched\nafter the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.\n    \"There is no leftist alternative to the reforms,\" he said.\n\"There is no going back to the policy of strict central control.\nBut the reforms will take years.

Most\nwill be taxed at 20 pct, although basic foods, urban transport,\nfuel, pharmaceuticals and probably homes and building materials\nwill be zero-rated. Non-basic services will be taxed at 10 pct.\n    Several other taxes will be abolished when VAT comes in\nnext January 1 and the effect will be to cut producer prices by\nbetween five and 10 pct, MTI said.\n    Consumer prices will rise by about eight pct as result of\ncuts in subsidies, including those on milk and dairy products,\nMTI said. It did not say what effect the VAT would have.\n    Basic changes in company taxation were necessary as varying\ntaxes and subsidies gave a confusing picture, and minor steps\ntaken so far had only improved things temporarily.\n    MTI said inefficient firms were still being maintained at\nthe expense of efficient ones, whose profit incentive was\nblunted by an average profit tax of 80 pct. The idea was to\ngive all ventures equal chances and eliminate distinctions.\n    \"Valid preferences or supports are to be withdrawn, or at\nleast reduced,\" MTI said.\n    The tax changes will be a further step in a recent line of\neconomic reforms designed to boost company efficiency.\n    Management of 75 pct of all state enterprises passed from\nministries to elected enterprise councils in 1985 and 1986, and\na bankruptcy law in force since last September limits the duty\nof the state to save loss-making firms.\n    MTI said yesterday state subsidies to enterprises and\nindustrial cooperatives rose 16 pct last year, while profits\nrose 4.6 pct.

{"title": "U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH", "body": "The U.S. economy is showing some\npromising signs of accelerated expansion despite the\nsluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private\neconomists say.\n    Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December\nperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarter\nthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in\nJanuary slowed business and consumer spending.\n    But some of the latest economic data show signs of\nsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some\neconomists remain cautious about the outlook.\n    The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for\ndurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct\nrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense\ngoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency\nsaid.\n    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many\nfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to\nincreases of up to five pct.\n    The January/February employment statistics suggest the\nGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for\nthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an\neconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,\nthe lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm\njobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in\nJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.\n    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of\nabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.\n    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding\ntheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the\nsecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the\nsecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption\nand government spending. He also sees residential construction\ndeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.\n    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the\nfourth quarter slowness will continue.\n    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the\nfirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and\nshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.\n    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the\nU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in\nthe dollar's value over the last year and half.\n    \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy\npredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at\nleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the\nprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.\n    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,\nwhich soared to record levels last year, will improve this year\nand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the\nyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.\n    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.\nhas been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their\ndomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.\n    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the\npressure off the United States whose five years of economic\ngrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.\n    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for\ntheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to\nservice their foreign debt.\n    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a\nmodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.\n    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance\nbetween the volume of goods imported to the United States and\nthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of\nexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact\nthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened\nduring the closing three months of 1986.\n    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate\nprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the\ngovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measured\nby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a\nmoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.\n    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key\nelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in\nFebruary, after falling two pct in January.\n    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the\nmanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements\nof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.\n    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the\nFed said that economic activity in the various regions of the\ncountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.\nManufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most\nregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.\n    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the\npick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the\ndrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major\npick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy\nwill slip into recession either.\n    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts\nthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze\nconsumers purchasing power.\n    \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of\nyears,\" Chimerine said.

The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5\nbillion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil\nprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.\n    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North\nSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the\ncost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.\n    Day to day operating costs of the exploration and\nproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target\nis to keep costs per barrel constant.\n    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to\nthe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to\ngauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.\n    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a\nprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.\n    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell\nU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987\nwere a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"\n    In November and December in particular, refining operations\nhad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil\nproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continue\ngenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip to\nbecome negative from time to time, depending on price\nmovements.\n    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will\nnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five\nmonths behind schedule, following a crane accident which\nseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.\n    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from\n11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical\nsite.\n    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which\ncompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying\ndevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields against\nPRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.\n    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in\nthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he\nwould expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln\nbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.\n    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain\noutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,\nbut the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will\nfall.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

I\nthink the pattern has established itself here, and it's\nreasonable to expect further investment down the road,\" said\nPrudential-Bache Securities analyst Larry Eckenfelder.\n    Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokerage\nstocks, resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions.\n    \"The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution of\nthe value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going to\nbe a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the U.S.,\"\nsaid another analyst.\n    As globalization of the financial markets accelerates,\nJapanese firms are expected to turn their sights on the\nexpertise of the U.S. brokerage industry.\n    Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian market\nand Europe has also created a craving for more capital by U.S\nfirms.\n    \"Morgan (Stanley), First Boston, Salomon (Brothers),\nMerrill (Lynch). Those would be the firms more likely to\nconsider hooking up with a Japanese firm, and those would be\nthe ones the Japanese would be most interested in,\" Eckenfelder\nsaid.\n    All of those firms, he said, have been establishing\nthemselves in Japan.\n    While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably,\nthere is some underlying concern that Japanese companies may\nlearn enough from their U.S. partners to ultimately pose the\nsame type of competitive threat they have\nmade in electronics and automobiles.\n    \"The difficult issue is what investment really will lead to\nas markets deregulate.

For instance, analysts expect it to market the\nAmerican Express card more actively in Japan with the help of\nNippon.\n    \"The key to the deal is not just raising capital for\nShearson, but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon,\" said\nAlan Zimmerman of Kidder, Peabody and Co.\n    American Express stock responded favorably to the\nannouncements, climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today.\n    Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaining\na foothold in the U.S. market with the help of American Express\nand Shearson.\n    Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager to\nfollow Nippon Life.

Analysts say if the banks do not intervene\neffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.\n    \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6\ncollapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.\n    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their\nattention to capital movements whereas previously they had been\nrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.\n    However, although most analysts and foreign exchange\ndealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or\neven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp\ndrop in the U.K. Currency.\n    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.\nPolitical and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and\nrelatively high interest rates, they said.\n    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been\nrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen as\npopular both with the markets and with British voters.\n    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the\nWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is\ntrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.\n    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative\nparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also\nsupported the pound.\n    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two\nhalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than\ntwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the\nnext week or so, has already been largely discounted.\n    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still\nrelatively high compared to other western countries, and\nanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely\nto affect sterling.\n    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,\ndropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.\n    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange\nmarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond\n(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.\n    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has\nbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.\n    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady\nfor the next few days while the market awaits further\ndevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current\naccount figures for February.\n    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg\nafter January's small surplus.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}
